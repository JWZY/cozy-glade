# Criteria for Goals

> *"...it's a hassle to run four different games for four different players, which is essentially what you're doing if your four players have four disparate goals. Instead, guide your players during their goal formulation process to ensure that when the smoke clears, everyone's path forward is somewhat related. Players will naturally do this as they collaborate on their goal creation, and you may find that the character who wants to topple a local warlord and the character who wants to avenge their family's death at the hands of a local warlord have a common interest that's easily identifiable. Other goals will take more work to connect. As you listen to your players talk about the goals they'd like to chase, consider which goals you can bundle together."*

## 1. Each character should have multiple goals.

## 2. A goal should have varying time frames.
- Short to long-term.
- Treat it like a work back schedule.

## 3. Goals must be achievable.

This might seem straightforward, but it's not. Of course, we want our goals to be achievable—that's why we pursue them! But what "achievable" means in this sense is "measurable." Goals should be formulated in such a way that we know when we have attained them.

Consider the goal, **"I want to become more powerful."** A fine goal for a martially minded party member, but is it achievable? It depends on how we measure "powerful." A better goal bakes the subjective measurement of power, as determined by the character, into the wording:

- **"I want to win in a real duel against an opponent who is much stronger than me."**
- **"I want to win the martial arts tournament in Songul next year."**
- **"I want to single-handedly defeat Drathul the Dread-Winged."**

That goal expresses the same desire ("to be more powerful") but it's much easier to tell when the player is successful. They could also go with variations that add more interesting and more specific plot elements to the goal.

If the Game Master is reading through player goals and can imagine an encounter or reward that, once completed or attained, will clearly indicate the goal has been reached, it is an achievable goal. For example, if a character's goal is to "get revenge on the fallen paladin who killed my mentor," then an encounter in which the character fights and defeats that paladin clearly indicates the goal has been reached. If not, that player should brainstorm some encounters or rewards that might serve this purpose, or perhaps the goal needs to be changed a bit.

**Key points:**
- Specific and measurable
- Worded in a way that makes it clear when it is accomplished
- Take liberties for lore & worldbuilding to flesh out that goal
- But check-in with GM first for approval

## 4. Goals must have consequences for failure.

## 5. Goals must be fun to pursue.

## Example A.
**Create a Long OR Mid Term, and 2 Short Terms. Figure the rest out through play.**

### Long Term

### Short Term
**MULTIPLE**

1. Figure out how she sent me the message in my dream.

2. Find a portal into the Feywild.

## Example B.
**Creating a Long, Mid, & Short Terms all at once.**

### Long Term
Resurrect Ksthissa—the Snake God of my people—and gain a kingdom protected by their divinity for my people.

### Mid Term
**MULTIPLE (OPTIONAL)**

Find out if it is possible to resurrect or rebirth a God by talking to the hermit Storykeepers of Al'Shayen Temple in the Atlas Mountains.

### Short Term
