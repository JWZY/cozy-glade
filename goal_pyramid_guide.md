# Goal Pyramid Guide

## Overview
The Goal Pyramid is a framework for generating campaign arcs and encounters based on player motivations.

## Structure

### 1. The Capstone (Campaign Goal)
*   **Definition:** The overarching objective of the entire party.
*   **Example:** "Build a thriving settlement at Bonetop."

### 2. The Pillars (Character Arcs)
Each character has a personal arc that supports the campaign.

*   **Identity:** Who are they? (e.g., A retired soldier).
*   **Goal:** What do they want? (e.g., Peace).
*   **Obstacle:** What stands in their way? (e.g., Past trauma, new threats).

### 3. The Bricks (Session Goals)
Small, achievable steps that happen in 1-3 sessions.
*   *Ellery:* Find a reading nook.
*   *Halden:* Clear the land.
*   *Oleg:* Secure the perimeter.

## Generating Encounters from Goals
1.  **Select a Goal.**
2.  **Determine the Opposition.**
    *   *Faction:* Who opposes this?
    *   *Nature:* What environmental force stops this?
    *   *Internal:* What character flaw hinders this?
3.  **Set the Stakes.**
    *   What happens if they fail? (Consequence).
    *   What do they get if they succeed? (Reward).
4.  **Choose the Arena.**
    *   Where does this conflict happen?

## DM Checklist (Pre-Session)
*   [ ] Review current PC goals.
*   [ ] Identify which Faction is currently active.
*   [ ] Prepare one Combat encounter and one Non-Combat encounter.
*   [ ] Check for "Slice of Life" opportunities (cooking, crafting, talking).
