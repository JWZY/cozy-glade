## Backstory
- Halden grew up with the Scarlett Scale, a monster hunter company, where he travelled far and wide protecting innocents and honing his skills as a slayer of beasts. He wanted nothing more.
- Until he came across a homestead under attack by a great Griffon. He slew the beast, but the woman who lived there did not praise him, instead scolding him for hurting the animal for following its instincts.
- Halden, too stubborn to leave without coming to an understanding, stayed at Anja's property; she too was stubborn and refused to let him live it down.
- Instead of returning to the Scarlett Scale, Halden began doing chores around the farm in an attempt to ease the tension, though Anja always found a way to show him how he was doing it wrong.
- Eventually, Halden moves into the abode, becoming a true and essential part in the farmhouse, and more importantly, to Anja.
- Halden and Anja fall in love, and they spend a fruitful, long life together. But all is not easy in the world of love.
- A fight, a final straw, and Halden storms off, hearing about a Wyvern attacking a nearby town. Anja cries but will not beg Halden to stay. Halden slays the beast, but as he looks at his bloodied sword, no praise from the townsfolk amounts to the love of Anja.
- He returns to Anja, and vows to never unsheathe his sword again, and so he does. Anja grows old, and Halden knows he will outlive her. As they make preparations for her departure from this realm, Halden makes a third and final vow to his love; that he will spread her ashes at the spot in which Nature and Beauty Reigns.
- Now leaving the homestead with Anja in his heart and sword hung at his side, Halden finds a poster for an expedition, with a quote from Anja's treasured book;
