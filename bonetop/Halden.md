# Halden

**Ancestry:** Firbolg | **Class:** Seraph (re-specced from Brawler)

## Short-term Goals

**Build a tavern** — The homesteads are done, now Bonetop needs a communal gathering place.

**Find livestock** — Looking for a sheep equivalent to herd onto his homestead.

**Attract new settlers** — Give people a reason to come to Bonetop. Ideas include gathering ingredients for ale to get the pub started, drawing up advertisements for Vinos to send back to the mainland.

## Long-term Goal

**Spread Anja's ashes** — Find the place where "Nature and Beauty Reigns" to fulfill his final vow to his late wife.

## Developments

- Re-specced from Brawler to Seraph. Narratively unchanged — reflects Halden becoming more spiritually attuned to the settlers and the land. His healing now comes through cooking comfort food rather than brawling.
- Built small 1-bedroom homesteads for everyone in the settlement
- Attempted to domesticate a Wooly Moss Moose alpha. The alpha was in heat and imprinted on him — obsessively nuzzling and rubbing against him. A chase sequence ensued when Ellery put it to sleep and the herd panicked. In the final moments, Halden hesitated — a flashback to his vow to Anja not to harm creatures paralysed him, and the alpha broke free. It looked back at him with eyes not of rage, but of betrayal, before leading the herd back into the forest.
- The moose escaped, but the connection was made. Unfinished business.

## Relationships

- **Oleg** — Regular foraging partners. Oleg called him "dad" during the moose chase.
- **The Alpha Moose** — It got away. But it looked back.

## Completed Goals

- ~~Plot land for the town and his personal homestead (planted Anja's pear seeds)~~
- ~~Secure a communal lumber yard~~

## Appearance
- Tall, blue skin and windswept grey hair, specks of auburn in it.
- Large, barrel chested build, clearly used to tilling fields and working with his strength
- Dressed practically, work clothes, and light armour from his youth
- understanding of death and that his time may come soon. People person, though can be focused on his personal goals

## Backstory
- Halden grew up with the Scarlett Scale, a monster hunter company, where he travelled far and wide protecting innocents and honing his skills as a slayer of beasts. He wanted nothing more.
- Until he came across a homestead under attack by a great Griffon. He slew the beast, but the woman who lived there did not praise him, instead scolding him for hurting the animal for following its instincts.
- Halden, too stubborn to leave without coming to an understanding, stayed at Anja's property; she too was stubborn and refused to let him live it down.
- Instead of returning to the Scarlett Scale, Halden began doing chores around the farm in an attempt to ease the tension, though Anja always found a way to show him how he was doing it wrong.
- Eventually, Halden moves into the abode, becoming a true and essential part in the farmhouse, and more importantly, to Anja.
- Halden and Anja fall in love, and they spend a fruitful, long life together. But all is not easy in the world of love.
- A fight, a final straw, and Halden storms off, hearing about a Wyvern attacking a nearby town. Anja cries but will not beg Halden to stay. Halden slays the beast, but as he looks at his bloodied sword, no praise from the townsfolk amounts to the love of Anja.
- He returns to Anja, and vows to never unsheathe his sword again, and so he does. Anja grows old, and Halden knows he will outlive her. As they make preparations for her departure from this realm, Halden makes a third and final vow to his love; that he will spread her ashes at the spot in which Nature and Beauty Reigns.
- Now leaving the homestead with Anja in his heart and sword hung at his side, Halden finds a poster for an expedition, with a quote from Anja's treasured book;
