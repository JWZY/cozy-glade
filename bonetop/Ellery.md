# Ellery

**Ancestry:** Clank

## Short-term Goal

**Construct the Floating Library** — Assemble and complete the magically suspended library above Bonetop. The structure is designed but needs to be built and put together.

## Long-term Goal

**Graduate from the Academy** — Prove to her maker, Alprazepam the Stern, that creating Ellery and teaching her magic was worthwhile.

## Relationships

- **Oleg** — Birdwatching buddies (for fun)
- **Vinos** — Keeps pestering him to assemble the communication kit. He keeps saying "I'm working on it." He has not opened it.

## Completed Goals

- ~~Find the perfect reading nook~~ — Built the Floating Library: a magically suspended, self-stabilizing structure above Bonetop using lumber from the communal yard. A perfectly organized prefab set, levitated into the sky. Canonically did not design an entrance.

## Appearance
- Wooden dummy with a very faint yellow glow lining each wooden groove.
- Always has her 'spell bracer' with her.
- Sometimes wears a blue cotton cowl over her shoulders (official colour of The Academy)
- Often found lost in thought, studying magic, or closely examining the structure of nearby buildings

**Visual Inspirations:** Posable Wooden Humanoid Models for artistic sketching, Modern-Day Crash Test Dummies, Slight hints of geometric shapes from Gundam or other mecha anime

## Backstory
- Ellery was once nothing more than one of many automated wooden spellcaster dummies used within the Research Wing of The Academy. Imbued with simple, low-level instructional magic, her only purpose was to cast a stabilizing spell. Within the stabilized space, real mages tested their limits casting very powerful, highly chaotic magic.
- One fateful day, a high-ranking mage was demonstrating his experiential research in a desperate attempt to maintain his position in The Academy. Ellery, tasked with stabilizing the spell, was struck in the head by the ricochet of a stray arc of magical energy. That moment is when she became sentient.
- Her haphazard creator, Alprazepam the Stern, improvised this result and began to use her as his thesis in magically sentient spellcasters.
- He enrolled Ellery as an apprentice at The Academy while documenting and showcasing her manufactured intellect to the wider Academy community.
- Ellery was happy to learn about magic and was determined to show appreciation to her maker by becoming the first animated graduate of the Academy.
- Seemingly, without warning, Alprazepam the Stern ordered Ellery to cease her studies. He instructed her to accompany Vinos, the academy mailboy, on an indefinite 'journey' outside of the Academy walls.
