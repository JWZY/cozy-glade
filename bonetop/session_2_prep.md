# Arc 2: "The Thaw"

*Early Spring → Start of Summer — Time Skip & Worldbuilding Session*

---

## Opening: The Time Skip Montage

Start the arc with a collaborative montage. Each player narrates a short vignette of their character over the past few months. Give them these prompts:

> "It's been three months since you arrived at Bonetop. The snow has melted, the days are long and warm, and the settlement has taken shape. Tell us about **one thing your character built**, and **one thing that surprised them**."

Let each player take 2-3 minutes. Fill in NPC reactions as they go.

## How Bonetop Has Grown

*Use these as established facts, or ask players to confirm/adjust.*

### Infrastructure

- **The Clearing** is real now — Oleg and Halden's early work has turned into a rough perimeter. Tree stumps dot the edges. A low fence of stacked stones and lashed timber marks the boundary.
- **Halden's Homestead** is framed and partially roofed. One room is livable. The pear tree sapling is knee-high and growing fast — suspiciously fast. A small livestock pen sits empty, waiting.
- **The Lumber Yard** is functional but basic. Halden identified two wood types nearby:
    - **Weeping Crystal Pine** — soft, easy to cut, but bleeds red sap that stains everything. Good for interior work.
    - **Ironbark** — harder wood from deeper in the forest. Needs better tools to harvest. Essential for load-bearing structures.
- **Oleg's Mushroom Circles** ring the settlement's edge. They glow faintly at night. The local spirits have noticed.
- **Ellery's Reading Nook** — a sheltered alcove in the dragon's lower jaw, where two massive teeth frame a natural desk of flat bone. She's hung a tarp for rain and organized her scrolls. Vinos naps nearby.
- **The Hearthstone** — a communal fire pit under the dragon's ribcage has become the town square. Nellie's herb garden grows in the warm microclimate beside it.

### NPC Status

| NPC | What They've Been Up To | Current Mood |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Finley Boreas** | Grudgingly became the settlement's "social coordinator" — he organizes meals, mediates petty disputes, and keeps a mental inventory of everyone's complaints. Surprisingly good at it. Still hasn't done manual labor. | Restless. Bored. Scheming something. |
| **Nellie Saddler** | Treated: two sprained ankles, one nasty rash from Crystal Pine sap, and a Jub-jub bite. Established a small herb garden near the Hearthstone. Has been cataloguing local plants with medicinal properties. | Proud but frustrated — no one takes her "Modernistic Medical Association" seriously yet. |
| **Vinos** | Made three mail runs back to the nearest outpost. Each trip takes about a week. He's become the settlement's only link to the outside world. Seems unbothered by everything. | Chill. Always chill. |

## Scene 1: Morning at the Hearthstone

*Start of summer. The settlement wakes up.*

- **Setting:** Golden light through the dragon's ribs. Birdsong. The smell of Nellie's herb garden. Someone (Finley?) has hung decorative banners between two rib bones.
- **Prompt:** "What does your morning routine look like now, three months in?"
- Let players describe their settled-in habits. This grounds them in the new status quo before you disrupt it.

### The Mail Arrives

Vinos returns from his latest run, looking slightly less chill than usual. He's carrying a heavy satchel.

**Three letters:**

1. **For Finley** — Sealed with the Boreas family crest. Lord Boreas is sending an "assessor" to evaluate Finley's progress. Arriving within the month. Finley panics — he needs the settlement to look *impressive*.
2. **For Ellery** — From The Academy. Formal letterhead. Alprazepam's funding for Ellery's "field study" is under review. She must submit a "Thesis of Findings" or be recalled. Deadline: end of summer.
3. **For the Settlement of Bonetop** — A trade caravan is requesting permission to visit. They've heard about the settlement and want to establish a route. They'll arrive in two weeks. They're bringing supplies... and people.

**Player Reactions:** Let this breathe. Each letter creates personal stakes. Finley will try to recruit the PCs into making Bonetop look good. Ellery has a ticking clock. The trade caravan is an opportunity and a threat.

## Scene 2: The Pear Tree Problem

*Halden's pear tree needs attention.*

The pear tree sapling has grown unnaturally fast — it's already taller than Halden. The fruit is ripening early: oversized pears with a faint golden luminescence. They smell incredible.

**The Catch:**
- The fruit attracts creatures from the surrounding forest. Frog Boars are circling. Jub-jubs are hoarding fallen pears.
- The roots have spread far — Nellie's herb garden is being invaded by pear tree roots.
- **Oleg notices:** The mushroom circles near the tree are *thriving*. The spirits are feeding it. This is dragon-bone magic leeching into the soil.

**Player Choice:**
- **Harvest the fruit?** It's delicious, but is it safe? Nellie can test it (Alchemy/Knowledge check).
- **Contain the roots?** Halden might need to transplant or prune (Strength/Nature check). But cutting it feels wrong — it's Anja's tree.
- **Ask the spirits?** Oleg can commune with the mushroom circles to understand why they're supercharging the tree (Instinct/Spellcast check).

**Possible Outcomes:**
- The fruit is safe and *magical* — it heals minor wounds when eaten. This becomes Bonetop's first trade good.
- The fruit is a spirit offering — the Bone-Tenders planted extra magic in it as a gift to the settlers. Taking too much offends them.
- The tree is drawing something up from deep underground — the dragon's residual life force. If left unchecked, it could awaken something.

## Scene 3: The Spirit Accord

*The fey want to negotiate.*

Over the past three months, the Bone-Tenders have been increasingly active:
- Tools go missing and reappear *repaired* (but slightly wrong — a hammer with a bone handle, a saw with teeth made of crystal).
- Buildings shift a few inches overnight.
- Strange decorations appear — garlands of tiny bones, arrangements of river stones in spiral patterns.

**The Inciting Moment:** The settlers wake up to find that the communal lumber yard has been *completely reorganized*. Every log is sorted by size, stacked in impossible geometric patterns, and decorated with wildflowers. It's beautiful. It's also completely unusable — you can't pull a single log free without toppling the whole structure.

**The Bone-Tenders** emerge — small, crab-like fey creatures made of dragon bone fragments. They're proud of their work. They want recognition. They want a **pact**.

**The Negotiation (Social Challenge):**
- The Bone-Tenders want: a section of the settlement designated as "theirs" (a spirit quarter), regular offerings of interesting objects, and for the settlers to stop cutting Ironbark (it's sacred to them).
- The settlers need: the lumber yard functional, the building-shifting to stop, and tools left alone.
- **Oleg** is the natural mediator — he's been building rapport with the spirits.
- **Ellery** can document the accord (this could count toward her Academy thesis!).
- **Halden** has to compromise on Ironbark — maybe a sustainable cutting agreement.

**Complications:**
- Finley wants the spirit quarter to be *far away* from where the assessor will visit.
- Nellie wants to study the Bone-Tenders' repair abilities — she sees medical applications.
- The East Wind blows through during negotiations, being chaotic and unhelpful.

## Scene 4: Preparing for Visitors

*The trade caravan arrives in two weeks. Bonetop needs to get ready.*

This is a great **downtime montage** where players choose how to spend their time. Each player picks a project:

### Project Options

| Project | Lead | Challenge | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Build a proper gate/entrance** | Halden | Strength/Craft check | First impression for visitors. Finley insists on a banner. |
| **Map the surrounding area** | Ellery | Knowledge/Exploration check | Creates a basic map for traders. Discovers something unexpected in the process. |
| **Set up a welcome ward** | Oleg | Instinct/Spellcast check | Magical boundary that alerts settlers to approaching visitors. Spirits may "help." |
| **Prepare trade goods** | Nellie | Alchemy/Knowledge check | Catalogues what Bonetop can offer: Crystal Pine lumber, medicinal herbs, pear fruit(?), Frog Boar leather. |
| **Make Bonetop look "civilized"** | Finley | Charisma/Social check | Finley's desperate attempt to impress the assessor. Comedy gold. |

Each project takes about a week of in-game time. Players can assist each other for advantage.

## Scene 5: The Caravan Arrives (Cliffhanger)

*End of arc hook.*

The trade caravan crests the hill — but it's bigger than expected. Not just traders.

**What the players see:**
- Three wagons of supplies and trade goods (as promised).
- A well-dressed figure with a ledger — **the Boreas assessor**, who arrived early by joining the caravan.
- **2-3 new settlers** hoping to join Bonetop. Who are they? (Collaborative — ask the players to invent one each, or have pre-made options.)
- And at the back of the caravan, a hooded figure who asks for Oleg by name.

**End of arc.**

## Appendix: New Settler Ideas

*If players don't want to invent settlers, offer these:*

| Name | Ancestry | Occupation | Why They're Here |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bramble** | Faun | Beekeeper | Heard about the magical flora — wants to establish hives near the Crystal Pines. |
| **Suki** | Human | Blacksmith's Apprentice | Ran away from a cruel master. Has basic smithing skills — exactly what Bonetop needs for Ironbark tools. |
| **Old Marsh** | Katari (Tortoise) | Cartographer | Retired. Wants somewhere quiet to finish his life's work: a map of the entire frontier. |

## DM Notes: Threads to Track

- **Finley's Assessment** — Lord Boreas's assessor is judging whether Finley has "reformed." What counts as success? This is Finley's arc accelerator.
- **Ellery's Thesis Deadline** — End of summer. She needs documented findings. The Spirit Accord, the pear tree, the local fauna — all count. But The Academy may not accept "fey negotiation" as rigorous scholarship.
- **The Hooded Figure** — A representative from The Flipped Coin? Or someone else entirely? This seeds Oleg's long-term arc.
- **The Lake** — As summer heat intensifies, the lake level drops. Something is becoming visible beneath the surface. Save this for Arc 3.
- **Halden's Long-term Goal** — He still needs to find where "Nature and Beauty Reigns" to spread Anja's ashes. The pear tree's magical growth might be pointing him somewhere.
