# Bonetop

## The Setting
*   **Location:** A frontier settlement, far from the bustling capitals.
*   **Landmark:** The colossal, calcified skeleton of an ancient dragon, half-embedded in the earth. Its ribs form natural arches, and its skull serves as a grim but majestic lookout.
*   **Geography:** Nestled next to a vast, freshwater lake (to be named). The land is fertile but untamed.
*   **Seasons:** The region experiences four distinct seasons, each bringing its own beauty and challenges.
    *   *Current Season:* Early Spring. The snow is melting, the ground is soft, and life is waking up.

> *Life is what you create, moment by moment.*

## The Tone
**"Slice of Life" & Homesteading**
Inspired by *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End*, this campaign focuses on the quiet moments as much as the loud ones.
*   **Pacing:** Leisurely but purposeful. We will use **Liberal Time Skips** (weeks or months) to show progress in building the town.
*   **Themes:**
    *   Found Family & Bonding.
    *   The passage of time and the legacy we leave.
    *   Man vs. Nature
    *   The magic of the mundane.
