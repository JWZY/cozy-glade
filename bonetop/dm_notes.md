# DM Notes: Factions & Goals Analysis

*Strictly for DM Eyes Only*

## 1. Player Goals (Running List)
*Based on `IMG_7061.jpg` methodology.*

### **Ellery (The Academic)**
*   **Short Term:** Find the perfect reading nook near Bonetop.
    *   *Process:* Survey residents -> Debate with Vinos -> Vote.
*   **Long Term:** Graduate from The Academy; prove worth to Alprazepam.
*   **Potential Conflict:** The "perfect spot" is dangerous, occupied, or structurally unsound.
*   **Opposing Faction:** **The Academy** (Bureaucracy, Alprazepam's sudden silence).

### **Halden (The Builder)**
*   **Short Term:**
    *   Plot land for Town & Homestead (planting pear seeds).
    *   Clear pests/plants.
    *   Secure a communal lumber yard (cutting area, transport).
*   **Long Term:** Spread Anja's ashes in a place where "Nature and Beauty Reigns."
*   **Potential Conflict:** The land fights back (aggressive flora/fauna).
*   **Opposing Faction:** **Nature Itself** (or a Druidic circle/Spirit that resents the "taming" of the land).

### **Oleg (The Mystic)**
*   **Short Term:**
    *   Clear a perimeter (trees/pests).
    *   Establish shelter & traps.
*   **Long Term:** Establish contact with local Spirits (planting mushrooms). Deter "The Flipped Coin."
*   **Potential Conflict:** His attempts to clear the perimeter offend the spirits he wants to befriend.
*   **Opposing Faction:** **The Flipped Coin** (Crime Syndicate), **Local Spirits**.

## 3. The Wild Spirits (Fey Shenanigans)
*Since the party is settling near a magical dragon corpse, the local spirits are active and mischievous.*

*   **The East Wind:** A fickle spirit Oleg has spoken to. It loves gossip and moving small objects.
*   **The Bone-Tenders:** Small, crab-like fey creatures that "repair" the dragon skeleton. They might steal the party's tools to "fix" the dragon.
*   **The Echo:** A spirit that mimics the sounds of the dragon. It might roar when the party is arguing, or purr when they are bonding.
*   **Shenanigan Ideas:**
    *   The campsite moves 10 feet to the left overnight.
    *   All left shoes go missing, replaced by river stones.
    *   Firewood refuses to burn unless told a joke.
