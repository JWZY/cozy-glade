Okay, so you put the card... Wait, so you play... Reset. Oh, wow.

initial ones as well and then um the idea is oh yeah i'm i'm making an app right now and then 

Attendees
as well. Hold on. Oh yeah. Yeah. 

Microphone
for like a dagger heart character creator so i want to put like actual cards like interactions in the app so let's say if you have a hand like you have your subclass you have your ancestry you have your like uh community you can just have them like in in the car you can like flip through them 

Attendees
You can just have them you can like flip through them on the phone. 

Microphone
on the phone yeah or or on the desktop you open it up so it feels more like real and tactile 

Attendees
Oh yeah. Yeah, this is kind of like your vault, I guess,

yeah this is kind of like your vault i guess that they talk about in the game like your loadout vault 

Attendees
that they talk about in the game, like your loadout vault. 

Microphone
um yeah i like i like the dark wait what's it called dark mode kind of thing that you went for

Microphone
other way so um yeah let's see i want to like look at it a little bit more 

Attendees

Attendees
the cards that I sent you, Javin. Theirs is very linear. How do you call those? Like the end of the letter?

at this settlement the snow has melted away way everywhere now um days are getting longer and warmer um some of the early flowers have blossomed and have already gone away and there's a scent of like warmth and sweetness in the air around you it's early summer and the settlement around you has now really taken shape since it's been three or so months um you know at this point i would love to just to know what have your characters kind of been up to and since then 

Attendees
Mm-hmm. 

Microphone
uh what does it look like because hold into your short-term goal it was about uh let me just pull up that list it was about plotting out a portion of the land and setting up a lumber yarn which i think you have done maybe it's not completely you know polished not completely complete maybe you're still in the midst of uh gathering materials metals wood etc um but i would love to just get a sense of like you know what how has things uh how have things developed since then and on um olegs your medium-term goal i believe was to um something to do with like planting mushrooms and circles to gain favors with local fey spirits and singing favors with spirits in general making 

Attendees
Mm-hmm. Yes, right. 

Microphone
friends with local creatures uh how has that gone what progress have you made and interesting yes 

Attendees
Interesting, yes. 

Microphone
Yeah, Ellery, yours was to find the reading nook and that your long-term goal was to graduate from the academy. I'm just wondering how things have struck up. I've been speaking for quite a bit now, so I'm going to leave the floor to you once the chat. 

Attendees
I'll go first since I was last mentioned, I guess. 

Microphone
I'll go first since I was last mentioned, I guess. 

Attendees
So Ellery, with the help of the lumberyard, maybe has decided to construct a structure, believe it or not. 

Microphone
So Ellery, with the help of the lumberyard, maybe has decided to construct a structure, believe it or not. But it's going to be a library or reading community center in a clearing with wood from the lumberyard. 

Attendees
But it's going to be a library or reading community center in a clearing with wood from the lumberyard. But it's going to be magically suspended, which is totally her deal. 

Microphone
But, like, it's going to be magically suspended, which is totally her deal. There's this – I know we were all there for the acorn, like, person in the other campaign, 

Attendees
I know we were all there for the acorn person in the other campaign, where it was kind of like the residence was floating. 

Microphone
where it was kind of like – the residence was, like, floating. 

Attendees
It's kind of like that, but magic kind of thing. 

Microphone
It's kind of like that, but magic kind of thing. 

Attendees
And she would have been gathering materials and like making exact measurements and like laying them out. 

Microphone
And she would have been gathering materials and, like, making exact measurements and, like, laying them out. 

Attendees
But to wrap it all up, she has to cast a very important spell based on her experiences with like magical structures. 

Microphone
But to wrap it all up, she has to cast a very important spell based on her experiences with, like, magical structures. 

Attendees
And everything's like, you know, like alchemy circles or whatever. 

Microphone
And everything's, like, you know, like, alchemy circles or whatever and, like, Full Metal Alchemist where everything has to be set up to be, like, she has to, like, be there to, like, do the, yeah. 

Attendees
And like full metal alchemists where everything has to be set up to be like she has to be there to like do it. Yeah, so the components are the wood, 

Microphone
so the components are the wood and it's going to come up and like assemble and then rise and then 

Attendees
and it's going to come up and assemble, and then rise, and then hopefully stay there, 

Microphone
hopefully stay there based on hopefully with a roll i'm thinking like a duality dice roll 

Attendees
hopefully with a roll, I'm thinking, like a duality dice roll. 

Microphone
but uh the pieces are in place uh that's that's and we can revisit it whenever but like that that 

Attendees
But the pieces are in place. And we can revisit it whenever, but that would be a cool event, that roll. 

Microphone
would be a cool event so what is this for uh her to to find where she should read um she wants to 

Attendees
To find where she should read. She's taken the advice of... 

Microphone
she's taken the advice of um of uh i like basically veno vinos was the one who said 

Attendees
basically Venus was the one who said up high and then someone else said like together 

Microphone
up high and then someone else said like together um so she wanted a place and then um 

Attendees
so she wanted a place and then Halden said a barn loft like up like higher kind of so she took that 

Microphone
holden said a barn loft like up like higher kind of so she she took that and said like well like 

Attendees
and said like well like in the sunrise and sunset it'll be up up tall like just like a barn loft 

Microphone
in the sunrise and sunset it'll be up up tall like just like a barn loft there might even be a loft 

Attendees
there might even be a loft in it for that we would take that literally so she's kind of incorporating 

Microphone
in it uh valerie would take that literally so she's kind of incorporating all these like ideas 

Attendees
all these ideas 

Microphone
into and her own skill set uh to like build like a a thing but it's not like it's not built by 

Attendees
and her own skill set to build a thing. But it's not built by Summer. She's just been assembling, 

Microphone
summer it's she's just been like assembling uh you know helping other people coming back to it 

Attendees
helping other people, coming back to it. It just stays there. It's just 

Microphone
it just stays there it's just on the ground it's just to like mark out scrawlings or whatever to 

Attendees
on the ground. She has to mark out scrawlings or whatever to let 

Microphone
like let the lay lines flow when they do but it's just it's all set up on the ground ready to be 

Attendees
the ley lines flow when they do. It's all set up on the ground, ready to be rolled. 

Microphone
old yeah yeah i love that yeah like a perfectly organized lego set pre-building yeah like 

Attendees
Yeah. Like a perfectly organized set pre-building. Yeah, like... Oh, what do they call 

Microphone
what do they call that in architecture where they it's a miniature no 

Attendees
that in architecture? It's a miniature? No. 

Microphone
or something no they like pre-build the structure prefab oh it's prefab yeah prefab yeah yeah 

Attendees
Exploding or something? No, they pre-build the structure. Prefab, yeah. Prefab, yeah. 

Microphone
it's like mechanic or sorry are like magically prefabbed and like to scale everything yeah 

Attendees
It's like magically prefabbed. And to scale everything, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure you understand. 

Microphone
yeah i'm sure you i was thinking the explosion where it's like literal individual pieces of wood 

Attendees
I was thinking of the explosion where it's like literal individual pieces of wood on the floor yeah yeah no that's yeah that's what i mean like like uh 

Microphone
on the floor yeah yeah no that's yeah that's what i mean like like uh like it's like a barrel 

Attendees
it's like a barrel you know how the barrels are like held by tension from the uh from the band on 

Microphone
you know how the barrel is like held by tension from the uh from the band on like a like like a 

Attendees
like a like like a like a crate barrel it's all outside and the things in the middle uh and then 

Microphone
like a crate barrel it's all outside and the things in the middle and then there's all the 

Attendees
there's all the magic in between like the magical like markings and then she's gonna cast a spell 

Microphone
magic in between like the magical like markings and then she's gonna cast a spell and it's gonna 

Attendees
and it's gonna they're gonna bend and then the the things are gonna come on the sides and then 

Microphone
they're gonna bend and then the things are gonna come on the sides and then that's the barrel 

Attendees
that's the barrel. It's going to assemble 

Microphone
like it's gonna assemble itself uh and also float because it's magic cool hold on to that thought 

Attendees
itself and also float because it's magic. 

Microphone
for a second and i think it would also be cool if ellery's little treehouse uh is or like the 

Attendees
Yeah. 

Microphone
structure like are you thinking that it will be embedded to a tree like a tree house or something else or you're saying i was thinking like it was like a like her uh one of her interests like her 

Attendees
I was thinking it was like one of her interests, her special interest has been 

Microphone
her special interest has been uh and i'm just i'm not making this up like i i am i'm the creator but 

Attendees
and I'm not making this up I am the creator like this was declared um she really likes these like in the academy these like floating structures 

Microphone
like this was declared um she really likes these like in the academy these like floating structures 

Attendees
that like they were like turrets i call them tensor towers because it's like tensor's disc 

Microphone
that like they were like turrets i call them tensor towers because it's like tensor's disc floating disc from 5e but she really likes magical suspension and like those would use be used to 

Attendees
floating disc from 5e but she really likes magical suspension and like those would used be used to cast like automatic fireballs or whatever i like enemies to like protect the place uh so she really 

Microphone
cast like automatic fireballs or whatever i like enemies to like protect the place uh so she really 

Attendees
likes the structure and like how it stabilizes itself all the math it's like it's basically 

Microphone
likes the structure and like how it stabilizes itself all the math it's like it's basically 

Attendees
rocket science with magic. 

Microphone
rocket science uh so she she really likes all that stuff so she's just she's trying to try it out for 

Attendees
So she really likes all that stuff. So she's just trying out for herself, I guess. 

Microphone
herself i guess but with friendship because she wants space for her friends and there will be 

Attendees
But with friendship. Because she wants space for her friends. And there will be sound booths 

Microphone
sound booths in there for quiet reading like finley said like little sliding compartments i i love 

Attendees
in there for quiet reading. Like Finley said. Like little sliding compartments. Cubicles. 

Microphone
this idea but i have a question how would her friends or herself get into the library if it's floating in the sky we'll figure that out later i'd love if she didn't think about it that would 

Attendees
I'd love if she didn't think about it. That would be hilarious. 

Microphone
be hilarious and then we have to like like retroactively like find a solution oh yeah 

Attendees
We'd have to retroactively find a solution. They're like, Ellery? 

Microphone
they're like ellery yeah yeah how do you get in 

Attendees
Yeah? How do you get in? It's floating. Yeah. 

Microphone
in the other one there was in the sorry in the in the first dagger heart component like there 

Attendees
In the other one, in the first Daggerheart component, there was some sort of acorn, 

Microphone
was like some sort of acorn that like like a pulley system but um well we'll fight we'll figure 

Attendees
like a pulley system, but we'll figure it out. 

Microphone
it out she a cannon she forgets or she forgot to find an entrance because the turrets didn't need 

Attendees
cannon she forgets or she forgot to find an entrance because the turrets didn't need one 

Microphone
one like how did we get it in in her quest for perfect symmetry there's like no entryway it's 

Attendees
like she'd in her quest for perfect symmetry there's like no entry way it's just a perfect 

Microphone
just a perfect square yeah there's like two hinges two sets of hinges on the door for symmetry 

Attendees
square there's like two hinges two sets of hinges on the door for symmetry to keep them in yeah 

Microphone
yeah perfect awesome yeah uh yeah awesome okay let's who wants to go over next hold on world like 

Attendees
perfect yeah mm-hmm 

Microphone
i can go um so i've divided it into categories javin so uh in his like kind of spiritual 

Attendees
I can go. So I've divided it into categories, Javin. So in his kind of spiritual advancement realm, 

Microphone
advancement realm he wants to continue making offerings at the dragon structure so like whether 

Attendees
he wants to continue making offerings at the dragon structure. So whether the group wants to accompany him or him just periodically going alone, 

Microphone
the group wants to accompany him or him just like periodically going alone i think he wants to keep 

Attendees
I think he wants to keep trying to connect in that place. 

Microphone
trying to connect in that place but even though three months have passed he hasn't really been 

Attendees
But even though three months have passed, he hasn't really been able to connect meaningfully with the spirits of the area. 

Microphone
able to connect meaningfully with the spirits of the area um every time he tries he it's too intense 

Attendees
Every time he tries, it's too intense, and he stops early. 

Microphone
and he stops early and i think at this point he's decided that he might need to 

Attendees
And I think at this point, he's decided that he might need to form contracts 

Microphone
form contracts with like lesser spirits uh of the forest um health wise i think i imagine him 

Attendees
with lesser spirits of the forest. Health-wise, I think I imagine him kind of like foraging for like mushrooms and plants with Halden. 

Microphone
kind of like foraging for like mushrooms and plants with halden so i i imagine they have like 

Attendees
So I imagine they have like a ritual together where, you know, before Halden preps like the meals for the week or as he's like curating the menu, 

Microphone
a ritual together where you know before halden preps like the meals for the week or as he's like curating the menu um they'll go off on like foraging treks together and try to find various 

Attendees
they'll go off on like foraging treks together and try to find various things in the forest to bring back. 

Microphone
things in the forest to bring back um and it's a win-win because of course he gathers like 

Attendees
and it's a win-win because of course he gathers like ingredients and Oleg can gather components 

Microphone
ingredients and oleg can gather components um and for fun i'd say like him and ellery probably do 

Attendees
and for fun I'd say like him and Ellery probably do I feel like they have like bird watching 

Microphone
i i feel like they have like bird watching energy so i feel like they probably do like bird watching 

Attendees
energy so I feel like they probably do like bird watching together or like creature watching 

Microphone
together or like creature watching together like well they're they'll just go and like observe 

Attendees
together like well they'll just go and like observe things quietly and like oleg's just there 

Microphone
things quietly and like oleg's just there to like observe and be there and be like you know in the 

Attendees
to like observe and be there and be like you know in the moment but i feel like ellery's gonna like 

Microphone
moment but i feel like ellery is gonna like meticulously like take notes on like what she 

Attendees
meticulously like take notes on like what she observes um perfect he after three months i'm 

Microphone
observes um perfect he after three months i'm assuming the hot goss club has met a couple times 

Attendees
assuming the hot goss club has met a couple times and so oleg has taken it upon himself to always 

Microphone
and so oleg has taken it upon himself to always like crash their meetings and kind of interject 

Attendees
like crash their meetings and kind of interject and so he feels like he is a member but he he is not 

Microphone
and so he feels like he is a member but he he is not he just like takes note of when they're 

Attendees
he just like takes note of when they're happening and susses out when it's going to happen when 

Microphone
happening and susses out when it's going to happen when they're meeting and then he just shows up 

Attendees
they're meeting and then he just shows up there somehow some way um because he doesn't have a 

Microphone
there somehow some way um because he doesn't have a reliable way to get up to the tree house uh 

Attendees
reliable way to get up to the tree house uh he will ask haldin to throw his much smaller frame 

Microphone
he will ask halden to throw his much smaller frame up to the tree house every time he needs to 

Attendees
up to the treehouse every time he needs to crash the hot glass club yeah uh relationship rise 

Microphone
crash the hot glass club yeah uh relationship rise he is um oh i always forget her her name 

Attendees
he is um oh i always forget her her name not nelly i think it is i think oleg is probably going to go 

Microphone
not nelly i think it is i think oleg is probably going to go like golden retriever mode on nelly 

Attendees
like golden retriever mode on nelly and so he's gonna like constantly try to gain her favor but i 

Microphone
and so he's gonna like constantly try to gain her favor but i want it to be like a running gag that 

Attendees
it to be like a running gag that like it always ends up like ominous or not like well received 

Microphone
like it always ends up like ominous or not like well received like misinterpreted and but he's 

Attendees
like misinterpreted and but he's always going to be like putting him out there and like giving her 

Microphone
always going to be like putting him out there and like giving her like offerings making ritual 

Attendees
like offerings making ritual circles around her tent like just doing stuff that she did not ask for 

Microphone
circles around her tent like just doing stuff that she did not ask for out of like care um giving her 

Attendees
out of like care um giving her like candles with her hair in it and uh it's it's just not gonna 

Microphone
like candles with her hair in it and uh it's it's just not gonna land quite right so i feel like 

Attendees
land quite right so i feel like he's gonna try and like mend some of that relationship but he's just 

Microphone
he's gonna try and like mend some of that relationship but he's just making it progressively 

Attendees
making it progressively worse yeah 

Microphone
worse yeah perfect i love it yeah yeah so i'm giving you lots yeah yeah yeah that's awesome 

Attendees
yeah so i've given you lots 

Microphone
um hold it how's yeah yeah go ahead so uh over the last couple months um holden has uh the priority 

Attendees
yeah so uh over the last couple months um halden has uh the priority of uh crafting 

Microphone
of crafting. Like, he wants to 

Attendees
Like, he wants to make sure that this town, the town of Bone Top, truly is properly established. 

Microphone
make sure that this town, the town of Bone Top, truly is properly established. 

Attendees
He has spent a good chunk of time finally, like, putting in the work. 

Microphone
Nice. He has spent a good chunk of time finally putting in the work. 

Attendees
He has an actual house, like, a very small one-bedroom, like, home. 

Microphone
He has an actual house. Like, a very small one-bedroom home and would have gone about 

Attendees
And would have gone about assisting other members of the community building their small, like, little basically starter home. 

Microphone
assisting other members of the community building their small like little basically starter home single bedroom pioneer style um just simple but sturdy roofs over 

Attendees
single bedroom pioneer style. Just simple, but sturdy roofs over each other's heads, 

Microphone
each other's heads especially knowing that the winter is only you know a couple months away at 

Attendees
especially knowing that the winter is only a couple months away at this point. 

Microphone
this point we're halfway through the year um we would probably uh when he's not going out forging 

Attendees
We're halfway through the year. We would probably, when he's not going out foraging with Oleg, 

Microphone
with oleg um i think his spare time would have been working with ellery in uh like drafting out 

Attendees
I think his spare time would have been working with Ellery in drafting out plans 

Microphone
plans on how to do the uh the treehouse a lot of it not making any sense to him because he doesn't 

Attendees
on how to do the treehouse. A lot of it not making any sense to him because he doesn't understand how it's 

Microphone
understand how it's going to be suspended magically but he's like i can work my best 

Attendees
going to be suspended magically. But he's like, I can work my best to make the actual raw materials. 

Microphone
the actual like raw materials so he's like notching uh wood so that it'll slot together 

Attendees
So he's notching wood so that it'll slot together and doing 

Microphone
and doing everything he can to make sure the craftsmanship is good enough for a community center. 

Attendees
everything he can to make sure the craftsmanship is good enough for a community center. probably notably 

Microphone
Probably notably in the closer to where he imagined center of town would be. 

Attendees
in the closer to where he imagines center of town would be he is in the process of 

Microphone
He is in the process of building what will eventually hopefully become a small pub, 

Attendees
building what will eventually hopefully become a small pub like a community gathering area 

Microphone
like a community gathering area. 

Attendees
yeah 

Microphone
Yeah. 

Attendees
Alden is making 

Microphone
Walden is making a tavern. 

Attendees
a tavern 

Microphone
um okay can we say that these could be things that will get completed over the course of the year because i think i don't know if three months is a long time or if it's actually reasonable for 

Attendees
yeah 

Microphone
people back in the day with all these structures yeah yeah it's it's more i'm more pointing out 

Attendees
Oh, all these structures, yeah. Bear. 

Microphone
that if ellery is taking three months to struggle with putting up a tree house and you build five homes and like a lumberyard and uh um and a tavern i'm just wondering if there's like a way to kind 

Attendees
Congruence, yeah. 

Microphone
of balance that out if it makes sense maybe that's the grand plan maybe he's laid out kind of like the law so where it will be he has like blueprints yeah yeah or something like okay yeah yeah yeah 

Attendees
Maybe he has blueprints, yeah. yeah okay yeah yeah or 

Microphone
so so something that you can work towards more in like the next couple seasons like oh everyone's got houses now by the end of the season and then you know by maybe by fall uh or start of winter the tavern will be up and running or something like that is that it that's totally cool we we 

Attendees
got it that's totally fine we we could even roll to see like how efficient like or how much how 

Microphone
could even roll to see like how efficient progress like or how much how much progress we make on 

Attendees
much progress we make on certain structures there must be like some sort of mechanic we could make 

Microphone
certain structures there must be like some sort of mechanic we could make yeah yeah yeah for sure 

Attendees
up for that. 

Microphone
yeah okay cool that's awesome um so let me see 

Attendees
Okay. Cool. 

Microphone
um great yeah so holden is out here being the settlement dad and then got little swims and he's actually doing 

Attendees
He's actually doing useful things. 

Microphone
out here being reasonable 

Attendees
Out here being reasonable. 

Microphone
okay uh the question is what's next i have a sense of what everyone is doing now but okay has anyone done anything with finley did we mention finley the oh oh my god javin what is 

Attendees
has anyone done anything with Finley did we mention Finley oh my god Javin what is Finley up to 

Microphone
finley up to that is very important did he complete this did he complete the cedar chest like um 

Attendees
that is very important did he complete the cedar chest 

Microphone

Attendees
like further into his misery.

Microphone
um flocking to the candle and he's curious why he's got more moths than anyone else in his room 

Attendees

um but that'll be a mystery for another time i see yeah yeah who like how is the hot goss club 

Attendees
I see yeah who like how is the hot goss club going who's the leader 

Microphone
going who's the leader of this and yeah how fervent are people 

Attendees
of this and yeah How fervent are people 

Microphone
like when it comes to like updates from ellery's school 

Attendees
when it comes to updates from Ellery's school? Or the hot goss in the capital? 

Microphone
or the hot goss in the capital i was thinking that um like what what ellery has been doing 

Attendees
I was thinking that what Ellery has been doing with Venus is that she keeps coming 

Microphone
with venos is that she keeps coming back and being like is it is your like little messaging 

Attendees
back and being like, is your little messaging thing ready yet? 

Microphone
thing ready yet like the arcane uh transmitter and he's like uh yeah i'm working on it and then 

Attendees
Like the arcane transmitter? And he's like, yeah, I'm working on it. And then it turns over and he's just not even... 

Microphone
it turns over and like he's just not even like she's like okay i'll come back and he just hasn't 

Attendees
She's like, okay, I'll come back. And he just hasn't even opened the kit. 

Microphone
even open the kit like it's it's like he hasn't even started he's just like totally extended 

Attendees
He's just like... He's just like... Extended vacation. 

Microphone
yeah yeah yeah he just yeah he's just lying to her basically but like he's like you know he's chill 

Attendees
Yeah, he's just lying to her, basically. But he's chill. I don't know. 

Microphone
i don't know no communication yet we're still waiting on that he that magic thing he he gets 

Attendees
No communication yet. We're still waiting on that. That magic thing. 

Microphone
the academy weekly updates though somehow true but maybe this is one way this is one way communication 

Attendees
Yeah. true yeah okay so it's set up for him yeah 

Microphone
right now his arcade pager yeah yeah yeah it's like should yeah like hmm should we like write 

Attendees
his arcane pager yeah it's like should yeah like hmm should we like write down prompts for you 

Microphone
down prompts for you javin to like springboard ideas uh or i would say the goal should we need 

Attendees
Javin to like springboard ideas or should we each give like a prompt or 

Microphone
to give like a prompt or like how would you like yeah i have some stuff that i wanted 

Attendees
like how would you like yeah 

Microphone
to bring up i don't want to quite uh show you my hand just yet but for example the starting things 

Attendees
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah. 

Microphone
of how i would structure the next couple sessions is for example the um we can kind of rewind time a little bit just to play out some of those little more smaller scenes like for example 

Attendees
Of course. 

Microphone
one one scene that really came to mind for me vividly it's like oleg and haldon are out on like a forest walk or something right and the haldon has been talking about you know we're foraging 

Attendees

Microphone
him and ellery are polar opposites in terms of like how planned they approach life yeah yeah 

Attendees
polar opposites in terms of how planned they approach life. 

Microphone
um ellery has a good knowledge of like folklore and stuff like that she reads it like

Microphone
you're like oh what what could this possibly mean strange but she does remember it yeah that's 

Attendees
actually really interesting because there's like a book that inspired them finding this place or 

Microphone
actually really interesting because there's like a book that inspired them finding this place or 

Attendees
ellery finding this place through like research like the folklore book right yeah that was older 

Microphone
ellery finding this place through like research like the folklore book right yeah that was older 

Attendees

Microphone
exactly we can do it yeah we can do it before or during it's usually better before if we can all 

Attendees
and I'll agree on what's going to go on a little bit. 

Microphone
agree on what's like gonna go on a little bit but yeah that's narrative yeah ellery turns a page in 

Attendees
But yeah, that's the narrative. Ellery turns a page in the book 

Microphone
the book and sees something that's too close to home like we just end up in narnia and javin has 

Attendees
and sees something that's too close to home. Like we just end up in Narnia and Javin has a whole session

Attendees
R.I.P.

Microphone
- Yeah, I was thinking that after I like mentioned that after the three month period, I was like, oh, he's already done that. So I probably need to come up with something. - Yeah, short term.

Attendees
uh yeah i had a couple of short-term goals um holand would like to uh animal husbandry 

Microphone
Yeah, I had a couple of short-term goals. Holden would like to... Animal husbandry needs to find some sheep. 

Attendees
needs to find some sheep um but then also yeah i want to get a tavern set up i want reasons to 

Microphone
But then also, yeah, I want to get a tavern set up. I want reasons to bring in new NPCs as a player. 

Attendees
bring in new npcs uh as a player um i would like to start inviting new npcs into the town

Microphone
Because I told Javid for my long-term goal that I want to see where the jub-jubes take the teeth. 

Attendees
that I want to see where the jub-jubes take the teeth. And I feel like... 

Microphone

Microphone
I think he alluded to that they have to take them to some sort of deity or something that's queen of the jubjubes, but we'll see how that plays out. 

Attendees
or something that's queen of the jubjubes, but we'll see how that plays out. Yeah. 

Microphone
I like that there's, what if the forest was like ruled by several queens and they just each had their own little domain and like contracts with each other? 

Attendees
I like that there's... What if the forest was like ruled by several queens and they just each had their own little domain and like contracts with each other? I like that. Maybe that's one of the 

Microphone

And, yeah. 

Microphone
I love it. Yeah. 

Attendees
Give Javin more fodder. 

Microphone
Give Javon more fodder. 

Attendees
More fodder, less direction. 

Microphone
More fodder, less direction. 

Attendees
Yeah. 

Microphone
Do you want a rotating NPC cast closer to that? 

Attendees
Do you want a rotating NPC cast closer to that? You're saying every so often someone comes by to go to the tavern 

Microphone
You're saying every so often someone comes by to go to the tavern 

Attendees
is the ultimate stable condition, I'm guessing? 

Microphone
is the ultimate stable condition, I'm guessing? 

Attendees
Is that what you're trying to say? 

Microphone
Is that what you're trying to say? Not even rotating. 

Attendees
Not even rotating. Every so often, maybe once a season, 

Microphone
Every so often, maybe once a season, 

Attendees
I would like maybe a new NPC to show up. 

Microphone
I would like maybe a new NPC to show up. So we can start building a community within the town 

Attendees
So we can start building a community within the town that might show up for specific events or whatever. 

Microphone
that might show up for specific events or whatever. um but narratively i can't see a reason for new people to show up to specifically our location 

Attendees
but narratively I can't see a reason for new people to show up specifically our location 

Microphone
um so like maybe it's something like uh like like it is a pub or something we do 

Attendees
so like maybe it's something like it is a pub or something we do and word 

Microphone
and word somehow travels um i've written that like when vino sends up getting his like pager set up 

Attendees
somehow travels I had written that like when Vino sends up getting his like pager set up where he can send out messages 

Microphone
where he can send out messages yeah like he's literally sending advertisements or like updates 

Attendees
yeah like literally sending advertisements or like updates and maybe that like interests someone at 

Microphone
and maybe that like interests someone at the college um to like come out oh my goodness yeah 

Attendees
the college um to like come out oh my goodness yeah what if venus is like ends up being the 

Microphone
what if venus is like ends up being the social media manager for phone talk 

Attendees
social media manager for phone talk just he's just the pr yeah that's his like new gig 

Microphone
he's just the pr yeah that's his like new gig makes clipping videos 

Attendees
that's awesome yeah 

Microphone
yeah he's like bone instructable yeah and it's like outlined he's got the black outline with 

Attendees
he's like bone indestructible yeah and it's like outlined he's got the black outline with the white on the outside or whatever 

Microphone
the white on the outside or whatever whatever they do top 10 tavers in wilderness you don't want to 

Attendees
whatever they do must watch I wonder 

Microphone
miss yeah i wonder if like if he does travel back to the capital like will he bring any of these 

Attendees
yeah I wonder if like if he does travel back to the capital like will he bring any of these weird materials that we found from these various creatures like I feel like we could kind 

Microphone
weird materials that we found from these various creatures like i feel like we could kind of 

Attendees
of generate interest about the area but there needs to be yeah there needs to be some sort of 

Microphone
generate interest about the area but there needs to be yeah there needs to be some sort of link to 

Attendees
link to the capital to like draw people here 

Microphone
the capital to like draw people here the question is uh right because historically tamers existed alongside they're like kind of like rest stops like on like on the go i think they're called or like en route kind of like that right uh they kind of like lie alongside major travel paths or trade 

Attendees
Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. 

Microphone
routes between major destinations so far we've established that this is a bit of a wilderness thing but we could always you know right con and just say actually it's between two major settlements 

Attendees
Yeah. Yeah. 

Microphone
it's just people don't usually go through this part for whatever reason so it's kind of like 

Attendees
Oh, shoot. 

Microphone
maybe off the main path but it's like a detour that's worth taking or something like that we could just say you know it's not too far away from the capital but it's like it's far enough away that people don't really kind of enjoy or something along those lines okay yeah yeah we 

Attendees
Okay. Yeah, yeah. 

Microphone
could always say that so that gives more of a reason for people like say hey you're already 

Attendees
Yeah. 

Microphone
taking that other route which is actually less scenic or like less interesting why not come by 

Attendees
Mm-hmm. 

Microphone
our little kind of like safe haven he we build like a little billboard along the along the 

Attendees
We build, like, a little billboard along the main road. 

Microphone
along the main road we build some advertisements yeah yeah billboard yeah if we could have like a 

Attendees
We build some advertisements. Yeah, billboard. Yeah. We could have, like, an influx from, like, a detour 

Microphone
yeah we we could have like an influx uh from like a detour or something on a trail like we're like 

Attendees
or something on a trail. Like, where, like, more people have to go there 

Microphone
uh like more people have to go there because it was like an avalanche or something or 

Attendees
because it was, like, an avalanche or something, or some sort of-- 

Microphone
uh some sort of like the road is blocked that's just like a basic they have to go around right 

Attendees
Like, the road is blocked. That's just like a basic. They have to go around, right? Or they took a wrong turn. 

Microphone
or they took a wrong turn people can just get lost people get lost all the time yeah yeah and 

Attendees
People can just get lots. I don't know. Whatever. Yeah. 

Microphone
if there's nothing else around here people aren't gonna you know stick around but we could always 

Attendees
Yeah. 

Microphone
just say like oh um like a plot i just suddenly manifested it's kind of like oh maybe there's like a literal like a travel blogger or something he got lost going towards the capital one day and he literally was like oh thank god i saw your like magical library in the distance and like i 

Attendees
Oh my god. 

Microphone
followed the light from the library at night the landmark yeah and then like i found you guys i'm 

Attendees
oh yeah it's a landmark yeah 

Microphone
so glad i did right and then you guys nurse him back to hell or something and he goes back and he brings more people over so yo this is like an awesome place oh we could play out that scene too 

Attendees
yeah oh we could play out that scene too if you wanted to play the travel magical travel blogger javin 

Microphone
if you wanted to play the travel magical travel vlogger javan i yeah i i think yeah but like uh 

Attendees
yeah 

Microphone
step one i think we have plenty of fuel for the next probably like five six sessions i would 

Attendees
yeah 

Microphone
imagine but there's a lot of like little interesting like bits and pieces that we're gonna play play out over the course of this so um i know we just did a lot of prep work right now but 

Attendees
I want to find the bad luck queen bee. 

Microphone
should we get started finally yeah yes yeah okay um okay second art i think the first logical scene is do we want to have halden do some sort of role or skill check just to see how his like things have been like progressing like the structure sees completely i can rip a skill check 

Attendees
I can rip a skill check real quick 

Microphone
real quick what what are the conditions like what's gonna what's the worst that could happen 

Attendees
what are the conditions what's the worst that could happen and the best 

Microphone
and the best oh it's a great question to define the boundaries because like yeah yeah like sometimes 

Attendees
oh fair because like yeah sometimes you want to do that if we're just like kicking off with it 

Microphone
you want to do that if we're just like kicking off with it is is i think maybe the question to ask 

Attendees
I don't know 

Microphone
here is there a fun way for us to fail forward let's say if halloween rolls poorly here is there a way to still make it fun or is it kind of like it's not really that interesting if he just doesn't get his shit done good question yeah that's that's the question you gotta ask 

Attendees
good question yeah that's that's the question you gotta ask um 

Microphone
um but it could just be lying forward when it comes to building 

Attendees
I feeling forward when it comes to building 

Microphone
my opinion is he just does it but i don't know if like there can be like like that's what he does 

Attendees
my opinion is he just does it but i don't know if like there can be like like that's what he does right um but like jake can describe it and there could be we could like push the role to something 

Microphone
right um but like jake can describe it and there could be we could like push the role to something 

Attendees
like move the role up to something more risky or like exciting it's up to jake at the end of the 

Microphone
like move the role up to something more risky or like exciting it's up to jake at the end of the 

Attendees
day he's been given the the reins on this one but um i feel like howlin can build stuff right like 

Microphone
been given the the reins on this one but um i feel like howlin can build stuff right like that's his 

Attendees
that's his thing what what could yeah like one of my skills is is craftsmith um especially based 

Microphone
thing what could yeah like one of my skills is is craftsmith um especially based on the level up 

Attendees
on the level up with the amount i was doing with the last couple sessions um i'm not sure 

Microphone
with the amount i was doing with the last couple sessions um i'm not sure like specifically how 

Attendees
like specifically how fun it is like like what a fun way to if it fails you know what i mean 

Microphone
fun it is like like what a fun way to if it fails you know what i mean um and i'm not quite sure what 

Attendees
and I'm not quite sure what cheese means 

Microphone
cheese beans uh um i i'm totally happy with just saying like we've got a couple shelters up people 

Attendees
I'm totally happy with just saying we've got a couple shelters up people can not sleep outdoors 

Microphone
can not sleep outdoors i i feel like a fun oh maybe a fun way to fail is like maybe there's some sort 

Attendees
I feel like a fun maybe a fun way to fail is maybe there's some sort of 

Microphone
of he's built it but there's some sort of error like like ellery's like oh it's floating in the 

Attendees
he's built it but there's some sort of error Ellery's like oh it's floating in the sky 

Microphone
sky and there's no entrance like maybe rain actually does come through where maybe there's 

Attendees
and there's no entrance maybe rain actually does come through where maybe there's like it's prone to like mice infestations or that's not as fun but like 

Microphone
like it's prone to like mice infestations or that's not as fun but like maybe there's some 

Attendees
maybe there's some sort of quirky error that like occurs even like as he failed i'm not sure yeah 

Microphone
sort of quirky error that like occurs even like as he failed i'm not sure yeah that's i think 

Attendees
that's i think ellery's like treehouse in the sky is pretty classic yeah 

Microphone
ellery's like tree house in the sky is pretty classic yeah um which one are we talking what 

Attendees
which one are we talking what structure are we talking about so i think we got i think i think 

Microphone
structure are we talking about so i think we got i think i think we got mixed up here 

Attendees
we got mixed up here we're talking about halden right yeah no i was using ellery's like 

Microphone
we're talking about halden right yeah yeah no i was using ellery's like fail as like there's no 

Attendees
fail as like there's no ladder no entrance as like an idea of like failing 

Microphone
ladder no entrance as like an idea of like failing forward like failing but yeah how my okay i thought 

Attendees
forward like failing but fun yeah 

Microphone
about it just a second i think actually um we're not gonna do halden the failing when it comes to the building i think there's a lot more interesting stuff to be done if he fails during the animal husbandry part whether it's discovery whether it's tracking whether it's capturing whether it's 

Attendees
I see 

Microphone
taming of the livestock how's that sound sure yeah yeah okay let's uh do we let's play play 

Attendees
sure yeah sweet 

Microphone
out that scene actually so now you guys are one day like i'll paint the scene a little bit but then you two feel free to you know add details i'd love to just kind of hear what you're seeing in the scenes as well but like you know oleg and holden are on one of their like walks they're supposed to go foraging like what does that look like what are some things that are catching their eyes that's different what do you guys talk about on these blocks okay so to start they don't have 

Attendees
OK, so to start, they don't have a set direction. 

Microphone
a set direction um they practice deciding based on the vibe that they're feeling in the morning 

Attendees
um they practice deciding based on the vibe that they're feeling in the morning they'll just like 

Microphone
they'll just like point it's very spontaneous they'll just like take turns pointing in direction 

Attendees
point it's very spontaneous they'll just like take turns pointing in direction and like okay 

Microphone
and like okay we're gonna forage there there's like no order so that's i'll throw that out there 

Attendees
we're gonna forage there there's like no order so that's i'll throw that out there to start 

Microphone
to start and i'm not sure jake what what is there what does their trek look like yeah yeah um i think 

Attendees
and i'm not sure jake what what is there what does their trek look like yeah yeah um i think 

Microphone
uh the way they navigate because it is like foraging uh is what we're talking about um i think 

Attendees
the way they navigate because it is like foraging is what we're talking about i think holden is 

Microphone
holden is picking any sort of berry or fungi uh from like his waist up so you can see like 

Attendees
picking any sort of berry or fungi uh from like his waist up so you can see like if they're walking 

Microphone
if they're walking along a track all the stuff like up top has been picked 

Attendees
along a trap all the stuff like up top has been picked and then oleg's walking around like oh 

Microphone
and then oleg's walking around like oh yes it's a little shiny and it's not necessarily like 

Attendees
yes it's a little shiny it's not necessarily like yeah i i do like the idea of getting distracted by 

Microphone
i i do like the idea of getting distracted by like things other than what they're collecting 

Attendees
things other than what they're collecting 

Microphone
as well like i come back and half of oleg's stuff is like not like thinks that he would be edible 

Attendees
as well. I come back and half of Oleg's stuff is not things that would be edible. This was a shiny rock that I found 

Microphone
it's just like this was a shiny rock that i found and i put it in the bag yeah 

Attendees
and I put it in the bag. Yeah. 

Microphone
yeah that's hilarious yeah so at this point we're we're probably walking through the woods 

Attendees
So at this point we're probably walking through the woods 

Microphone
and uh it's looking pretty scarce halden looks down at his bag um and it's not uh it's not too 

Attendees
and it's looking pretty scarce. Holden looks down at his bag and it's not too full. 

Microphone
full um he probably gives a sigh and is like well i don't know if we can live off this these 

Attendees
he probably gives a sigh and is like well I don't know if we can live off this foraging materials much longer 

Microphone
foraging materials much longer i fear we may need to find a more sustainable 

Attendees
I fear we may need to find a more sustainable source of food 

Microphone
source of food if you know what i mean you know what like i don't really like 

Attendees
if you know what I mean you know what like I don't really like like interrupting 

Microphone
like interrupting the forest's like ethos but i could talk to like one of these trees and 

Attendees
the forest's like ethos but i could talk to like one of these trees and maybe they have some ideas about where 

Microphone
maybe they have some ideas about where is like a really good place to find a ton of mushrooms 

Attendees
is like a really good place to find a ton of mushrooms definitely absolutely i was also 

Microphone
definitely absolutely i was also particularly thinking um of animals that we could take a 

Attendees
particularly thinking um of animals that we could take a couple from the forest 

Microphone
couple from the forest keep ourselves take right good care of them keep breeding keep fed 

Attendees
keep ourselves take right good care of them keep breeding keep fed like the jub jubes 

Microphone
like the jub jubes yeah but or the bees oh wait so you want to we're gonna like be friends with 

Attendees
yeah but or the bees oh wait so you want to we're gonna like be friends with them 

Microphone
them but then he's like pausing but then we say goodbye to them well it's their time they get a 

Attendees
but then he's like pausing but then we say goodbye to them time. They get a nice, lovely 

Microphone
nice lovely life uh they're they're well fed they're well housed um we make sure that if they've got 

Attendees
life. They're well-fed. They're well-housed. We make sure that if they've got long wool, 

Microphone
long wool they're shorn so they aren't getting all raggedy they're not getting stuck on rusted 

Attendees
they're shorn so they aren't getting all fraggly. They're not getting stuck on 

Microphone
brussels little burrs in the woods i think we give them a right good life and in return they 

Attendees
little burrs in the woods. I think we give them a right good life and in return, they give us their sustenance. 

Microphone
give us their uh their sustenance um and that means we don't have to keep coming into this forest 

Attendees
That means we don't have to keep coming into this forest tromps 

Microphone
tromps in our little toes our feet across these unworn trails we leave less of a mark in the 

Attendees
on our little toes our feet across these unworn trails, we leave less of a mark in the long run, 

Microphone
long run even if it's more of an upfront cost okay so um that sounds like a pretty good deal 

Attendees
even if it's more of an upfront cost. Okay, so that sounds like a pretty good deal, 

Microphone
like because we basically give them like a really good life from what you're saying 

Attendees
because we basically give them a really good life from what you're saying. 

Microphone
um absolutely i i can so i'm gonna like talk to this you know what i'm gonna talk to this bush 

Attendees

Microphone
over here he points to like a berry bush um and i'm gonna ask it where to find animals but 

Attendees
He points to a berry bush. um and i'm gonna ask it where to find animals but i think i need your help describing like what 

Microphone
but I think I need your help describing like what, what exactly are we looking for? Like, 

Attendees

Microphone
and like throws him longingly he doesn't see it as like livestock for a second like it like it 

Attendees
longingly he doesn't see it as like livestock for a second like it like it makes him waver or sees him 

Microphone
makes him waver or sees him he sees him as a monster instead of livestock or like confuses 

Attendees
he sees him as a monster instead of livestock or like confuses him you know what I mean 

Microphone
him you know what i mean like he like he like he holds back because he's like scared of hurting it 

Attendees
like he like he holds back because he's like scared of hurting it I think didn't he promise his wife 

Microphone
i think didn't he promise his wife that he wouldn't give up his like monster hunting days or i forgot 

Attendees
that he wouldn't give up his like monster hunting days or I forgot that he wouldn't 

Microphone
that he wouldn't take up the sword. 

Attendees
take up the sword. He gets a flashback to that. 

Microphone
Yeah, so he gets a flashback to that. 

Attendees
Yeah. 

Microphone
Yeah, you know. Yeah. And although I'm not physically pulling a sword on this guy, 

Attendees
That's why it fails. I'm not physically pulling a sword on this guy. I am harming a creature. 

Microphone
I am harming a creature, yeah. Yeah. 

Attendees
I got it. 

Microphone
I got it. I got it. That moment of wavering is all it takes for the alpha to gain the momentum. 

Attendees
Oh no. 

Microphone
It shakes his antlers, And you just see Oleg, you get tossed up into the air like a little rag doll. You're spinning through the air as it kind of bucks you up. And it lands with his rear legs. And it basically just kind of wrestles you down on the floor. And it breaks free. And basically there's a pile of dust and leaves that get spread. But Oleg, as soon as you land, you look on the ground. This alpha is pissed off. It's standing on top of Holden and is looking to strike now. 

Attendees
I'm looking right at it. 

Microphone
I'm looking right at it. 

Attendees
Wait, it's looking to strike Colden? 

Microphone
Wait, it's looking to strike Holden? It's piss off right now, yeah. 

Attendees
Okay, is it our turn or is it the Moose's turn? 

Microphone
Okay, is it our turn or is it the moose's turn? It's fear, so I'm going to pan the attention back to the previous whore that was stampeding and attacking Ellery. 

Attendees
It's your turn. I see. 

Microphone
I see. Because you're made out of wood and magic. so you're not gonna have any broken bones but the thing is the stampede it damages um i'm gonna say it damages a portion of your maybe your circuitry or maybe the arcane conduit binding you together as a sentient creature and the the spell you were previously preparing to cast the 

Attendees
Mm hmm. 

Microphone
spell to raise your magic library but because you're like dampening bracelet it gets it got 

Attendees
*Minds of the game* 

Microphone
broken during the stampede you probably need to find some way of fixing that first before you can 

Attendees
Mhm. 

Microphone
get your library back in shape okay sounds good yeah and but suddenly the horde turns it looks 

Attendees
Oh, no. Okay, sounds good. Damn. 

Microphone
around and notices that it seems they just seem a little bit confused why they're beating up like this wooden wooden dummy right it looks it starts to sniff and track its alpha and uh they start to 

Attendees
Right. 

Microphone
slowly trot towards the direction where you guys are running off to so the the pack is still on the trail they abandoned me because i'm a piece of wood i'm gonna say that for now because you are 

Attendees
they abandoned me because I'm a piece of wood 

Microphone
not that important to this right now in the moment you're not that important allory feels not that 

Attendees
oh yeah but Ellery feels not that important 

Microphone
important because these animals don't even recognize her oh like a threat yeah psychic damage 

Attendees
Because these animals won't even recognize her as a threat. Yeah. Psychic damage. She's like, aw. 

Microphone
it makes sense like like like canon wise but like rejected mark mark insecure
