# Arc 2: "The Long Summer"

*Early Summer → Late Summer | Portents & Pressures*

---

## Where Things Stand

The moose domestication attempt failed. Ellery's dampening bracelet is shattered. The alpha's eyes held betrayal, not rage. Early summer. The settlement is fragile and growing. The world outside is starting to notice.

---

## The Summer Clock

A Long-Term Countdown (10) runs in the background. It ticks once per in-game week. When it hits zero, summer ends and everything that's been building arrives at once. Track it loosely — the days get shorter, the light changes, the pear tree's fruit ripens faster than it should.

---

## Faction Portents

Each faction has a **goal**, a **method**, and an **escalation chain** — three stages of action they'll take regardless of the party. If a stage isn't engaged, it resolves on its own and the next begins. The world moves.

---

### The Bone-Tenders

**Goal:** Formal recognition. A Spirit Accord designating sacred ground and rules of coexistence.

**What They Want:** A spirit quarter (designated territory), regular offerings of interesting objects, and a ban on cutting Ironbark without permission.

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — The Mandala.**
The Bone-Tenders reorganize the lumber yard overnight into a beautiful, unusable geometric mandala. Every plank sorted, Crystal Pine sap tracing glowing red lines between concentric rings. It's a contract template laid out in wood.

*If unresolved:* The mandala spreads. Tools appear "repaired" with dragon-bone modifications. Buildings shift inches each night.

**Stage 2 — The Ironbark Embargo.**
The Bone-Tenders actively guard all Ironbark within a half-mile. A large Bone-Tender stations itself at the lumber yard entrance. Tools brought near Ironbark get snapped in half. Construction slows.

*If unresolved:* The settlement can't build anything sturdy. The incoming trade caravan sees a half-finished town.

**Stage 3 — The Withdrawal.**
The Bone-Tenders stop all activity. No repairs. No decorations. No glowing mushroom circles. The ambient magic nurturing the area — the pear tree's growth, the warm microclimate at the Hearthstone, the herb garden — begins to fade. The land gets colder. Quieter. Lonelier.

---

### The Boreas Family

**Goal:** Determine whether Finley's exile is producing results. Extract value.

**Key NPC: Laureth** — Boreas family assessor. Prim half-elf, clipboard, zero patience. Arrives with the trade caravan.

**The Contradiction:** If Bonetop looks too successful, Finley is "enjoying himself" and the punishment isn't working. If it looks like a failure, the investment is wasted. The only passing grade is "productive suffering."

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — The Assessment.**
Laureth arrives, observes, takes notes. Every interaction in her presence is quietly evaluated. She doesn't announce her criteria.

*If unresolved:* Laureth forms her own conclusions. Without context, Bonetop looks like a vanity project. Unfavorable report.

**Stage 2 — The Condition.**
The Boreas family issues a condition: Bonetop must produce something of "verifiable commercial value" by autumn. Not survival — commerce.

*If unresolved:* Funding is cut. Finley receives a recall letter. He doesn't want to go.

**Stage 3 — The Recall.**
A Boreas representative arrives to collect Finley. The settlement loses its social coordinator, its funding source, and the person who — against everyone's expectations — became the heart of daily life.

---

### The Flipped Coin

**Goal:** Reclaim a runaway. The rite of passage was never completed. The family wants him back — or the debt settled.

**Method:** Social infiltration. Patience. Leverage.

**Key NPC: Tetch** — arrives with the trade caravan. Charming, helpful, unremarkable. Faint green tattoos between the fingers. Stays behind after the caravan leaves.

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — The Embed.**
Tetch settles in. Hauls lumber. Shares meals. Teaches card games at the Hearthstone. Everyone likes Tetch. Meanwhile: mapping the settlement, learning routines, building relationships that could become leverage. A single copper coin left on a doorstep — one side smooth, the other etched with a tiny skull.

*If unresolved:* Tetch builds deeper relationships. NPCs defend Tetch's presence. The social web tightens.

**Stage 2 — The Message.**
A second coin appears — inside the settlement. Wedged into a doorframe. The message: *"We can reach what you care about."* If confronted privately, Tetch drops the act: *"The family misses you. Your rite is still waiting. Come home, and all debts are settled. Stay, and debts have a way of spreading to the people around you."*

*If unresolved:* Small things go missing. A favorite mug, a sentimental keepsake, a letter. Then they reappear, slightly moved.

**Stage 3 — The Offer Expires.**
Tetch leaves — but leaves gifts for each NPC befriended. Each gift contains a hollow compartment. Currently empty. A letter arrives via unknown courier: *"The family has been patient. Patience has a price. The rite will be completed — by you, or for you."*

---

### The Academy

**Goal:** Recover a valuable research artifact that has been operating unsupervised. Some within the Academy view her as a student. Others view her as evidence. A smaller faction views her as a threat.

**Method:** Institutional reach. Letters, emissaries, and the quiet assumption that property returns when called.

**The Subtext:** Alprazepam removed her before something worse happened. Vinos was sent along as a minder — and has been sitting on the communication kit ever since, because opening it means the Academy knows where they are.

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — The Kit Gets Opened.**
Pressure (social, practical, or accidental) finally forces the communication kit open. Inside: a sending stone, Academy stationery, and a sealed personal letter from Alprazepam. The letter is short: *"I sent you away because they were going to disassemble you. Prove them wrong."* The sending stone activates on contact — the Academy now knows the kit's location.

*If unresolved:* The sending stone pulses periodically. Messages arrive — formal, clinical, addressed to "the Alprazepam Construct." Not by name. They request a status report.

**Stage 2 — The Observer.**
The Academy sends someone to assess the situation in person. Young, nervous, genuinely fascinated — but reporting back to the faction that pushed for disassembly. They don't arrive hostile. They arrive curious, clipboard in hand, asking questions that sound academic but feel like an inventory: *"Can you describe your decision-making process? Do you experience preference? When you say you 'want' something, what do you mean by that?"*

*If unresolved:* The observer writes their own report. Without guidance, they describe a sentient construct living independently, forming relationships, making autonomous decisions. To the wrong reader at the Academy, that's not a success story — it's an uncontrolled experiment.

**Stage 3 — The Recall.**
A senior official arrives with a formal recall order. Procedural, not violent. *"The Alprazepam Construct is to report for comprehensive evaluation at the Academy's Research Wing."* They brought a dampening collar. They brought a crate. They call it "transport equipment." They are not being cruel. They genuinely do not understand why anyone would object.

**The Question:** Is she a person who was enrolled at a school, or a research artifact that was given too much autonomy? The Academy hasn't decided. That's what the evaluation is for.

---

### The Scarlett Scale

**Goal:** Recruit a former monster hunter. Not to hunt — to teach. The company has changed leadership, shifted from extermination to conservation.

**Method:** A personal appeal that challenges identity.

**Key NPC:** A stranger — travel-worn, scarred, carrying a worn leather case with a faded insignia: three claw marks in red. Arrives on foot, alone, asking for someone by an old name.

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — The Arrival.**
The stranger appears. Polite. Doesn't demand anything. Asks for a conversation. The old name is a key to a past that was supposed to stay buried.

*If unresolved:* The stranger waits. Sets up camp outside the settlement. Willing to wait as long as it takes.

**Stage 2 — The Offer.**
*"We don't hunt anymore. We protect. We need people who understand creatures — really understand them. Not to kill. To teach others how to coexist."*

The offer is genuine. It's also an identity crisis wrapped in a compliment.

*If unresolved:* The stranger leaves a leather journal. Inside: case studies of creatures protected, habitats preserved, herds relocated. The last page is blank with a note: *"This page is for your work here. When you're ready."*

**Stage 3 — The Mirror.**
News arrives that a creature near a neighboring settlement is causing problems. The settlers there want it killed. The Scale wants someone to prove there's another way. Not pressure — an open door.

---

### The Forest Queens

**Goal:** Maintain territorial sovereignty. The forest has rulers — the Bad Luck Bee Queen, the Jub-Jub Queen, and others not yet known. Bonetop exists at their sufferance.

**Method:** Territorial enforcement. Taxes. Tests.

**Escalation:**

**Stage 1 — Border Friction.**
As the settlement grows, it encroaches on the Bee Queen's buffer zone. Foraging trips take longer. Paths overgrow overnight. Small misfortunes cluster near the forest edge: twisted ankles, spoiled food, tools that break at the worst moment. The bees are enforcing a border the settlers didn't know existed.

*If unresolved:* The buffer zone expands. Resources become harder to reach.

**Stage 2 — The Invitation.**
The Bone-Tenders leave a rough map — a path deep into the forest marked with a hexagonal symbol. To reach the Jub-Jub Queen's territory, the path passes through the Bee Queen's domain. This is either a gift or a test.

*If unresolved:* The map fades. The Bone-Tenders don't offer again. The deeper forest remains unknown.

**Stage 3 — The Demand.**
A queen sends an emissary — not a creature, but a change in the environment itself. The Jade Trees nearest Bonetop darken. The honey-glow dims. The Jub-Jubs stop visiting. The forest is withdrawing its gifts. Something is expected in return.

---

### The Pear Tree

Not a faction — a portent. The tree doesn't have goals. It has momentum.

**Stage 1 — Abundance.** The tree is taller than it should be. Fruit ripening early — oversized pears, faint golden luminescence, incredible scent. Attracts creatures. Roots spreading into neighboring gardens.

**Stage 2 — Reproduction.** A fruit drops and splits open. Seeds inside have already sprouted — tiny green tendrils reaching outward. Impossible for normal pear trees. By autumn: saplings. By next year: an orchard.

**Stage 3 — The Revelation.** The fruit has properties beyond nutrition. This is Bonetop's most obvious trade good — and its most dangerous secret. Selling dragon-magic fruit to the outside world means exposing what Bonetop sits on. Every faction above has a reason to care about this.

---

### The Lake

Save for Arc 3. As summer heat intensifies, the lake level drops. Something is becoming visible beneath the surface. Don't reveal what. Let someone notice.

---

## Environments

Use these when the fiction calls for them. They're not tied to specific sessions — deploy when the situation matches.

# BONE-TENDER MANDALA

***Tier 2 Social***
*The lumber yard transformed overnight into concentric spirals of sorted wood, Crystal Pine sap tracing glowing red lines between the rings like veins.*
**Impulses:** Rearrange into proper order, demand recognition, test the newcomers' patience

> **Difficulty:** 14
> **Potential Adversaries:** Young Dryad, Sylvan Soldier, Tangle Bramble Swarm, Deeproot Defender

## FEATURES

***Sacred Geometry - Passive:*** A PC can make a Knowledge or Instinct Roll to read the pattern's meaning. On a success with Hope, they recognize it as a contract template — the Bone-Tenders are laying out terms in wood. On a success with Fear, they understand it's a demand but not the specifics. On a failure, they can mark a Stress to realize the pattern is deliberate, not random.

  *What does the pattern remind you of? Who taught you to read intent in things that don't speak?*

***Offering Circle - Action:*** Reveal that the central Ironbark stump accepts offerings. A meaningful gift (crafted items, food prepared with care, a personal possession) causes the Bone-Tenders to rearrange nearby wood into a reciprocal gift — a tool, a carved object, or a fragment of shaped dragon bone. Thoughtless offerings are ignored or buried.

  *What did you choose to give, and what did it cost you? What shape did they choose for you — and what does that say about how they see you?*

***Crystal Sap Surge - Reaction:*** When magic is used within the mandala, the Crystal Pine sap lines flare and shift, rearranging sections of the pattern. Unstable or uncontrolled magic causes a stronger reaction — the sap traces new patterns that a PC can read with a successful Knowledge Roll, revealing that the sap responds to magical frequency and could be adapted as a dampening circuit.

  *What does it feel like to see something respond to magic with curiosity instead of fear?*

***Territorial Snap - Reaction:*** When a PC attempts to take Ironbark from the mandala or surrounding area without permission, a large Bone-Tender (the size of a dinner plate, crystallized pincers) emerges and snaps the tool in half. The PC must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 1d8+3 physical damage. The Bone-Tender retreats immediately after.

  *What does the Bone-Tender's face look like — angry, afraid, or something else entirely?*

---

# CARAVAN MARKET

***Tier 2 Social***
*A makeshift market erupting between dragon ribs and wagon-wheels, the smell of foreign spices mixing with Crystal Pine sap.*
**Impulses:** Size up every stranger, find leverage in every exchange, put on a good show

> **Difficulty:** 13
> **Potential Adversaries:** Merchant Baron, Sellsword, Masked Thief, Petty Noble

## FEATURES

***What's For Sale? - Passive:*** PCs can negotiate for supplies with a Presence Roll. On a success, they get a fair deal. On a success with Hope, they get a bonus — useful gossip, an extra item, or a trader's favor. On a failure, the price is inflated. On a failure with Fear, the trader mentions the party's needs loudly enough for someone they'd rather not overhear.

  *What's the one thing you need most from this caravan? What are you willing to trade — goods, favors, or information?*

***The Assessment - Passive:*** A Boreas family assessor is watching. Every interaction within her sight is being quietly evaluated. She doesn't announce her criteria, but there's a hidden Impression Tally the GM tracks. Three or more successes on Presence or Knowledge Rolls in her presence by session end = favorable report. Any result that makes the settlement look too comfortable counts against the tally.

  *What does she write on the clipboard? What does "productive suffering" even look like?*

***New Faces - Action:*** Introduce a new settler who arrived with the caravan. They have skills the settlement needs and a past that might complicate things.

  *What drew them to a place like this? What are they running from — or toward?*

***Sticky Fingers - Action:*** Spend a Fear. A figure among the traders has been watching too carefully. A PC must succeed on an Instinct Roll to notice something off — faint green tattoos between the fingers, eyes that track exits, a warmth that feels practiced. On a failure, the figure remains unremarkable. At session's end, a single copper coin appears on a doorstep.

  *Who left this? What does it mean to the person who finds it?*

---

# THE EMBEDDED THREAT

***Tier 2 Social***
*The settlement at twilight. Fireflies between dragon ribs. Laughter from the Hearthstone. Everything looks peaceful. Something is deeply wrong.*
**Impulses:** Build trust to exploit it, make leaving feel like betrayal, map every weakness

> **Difficulty:** 14
> **Potential Adversaries:** Masked Thief, Assassin Poisoner, Secret-Keeper, Jagged Knife Shadow

## FEATURES

***Social Camouflage - Passive:*** The infiltrator has advantage on all Presence Rolls with NPCs who don't know their true nature. A PC attempting to warn an NPC without concrete proof must succeed on a Presence Roll or the NPC dismisses the warning and becomes slightly more protective of the infiltrator. Providing physical evidence (a marked coin, tattoos) reduces the difficulty to 10.

  *What's the difference between charm and manipulation? When did you learn to tell them apart?*

***The Web - Passive:*** Over time, small details surface about the infiltrator's activities: they know where medicine is stored, they've mapped settlement routines, their gifts to NPCs contain hollow compartments (currently empty). A PC can make an Instinct Roll to notice one detail per success.

  *Which detail bothers you most — the practical knowledge, the gift, or the patience?*

***The Private Word - Action:*** Spend a Fear to have the infiltrator drop the social mask in a private conversation. They speak plainly about debts, rites, and loose assets. A PC can make a Presence Roll to push back. On a success, the infiltrator is genuinely unsettled. On a failure, the infiltrator notes the attempt and adjusts their strategy.

  *When the mask drops, what's underneath — a true believer, a fellow runaway following orders, or something you don't have a name for?*

***Things Go Missing - Reaction:*** When the infiltrator's presence goes unaddressed for too long, small personal items begin disappearing — a favorite mug, a sentimental keepsake, a letter. They reappear a day later, slightly moved. Nothing is taken. The message is the movement.

  *What went missing? Why does that object matter more than its value? What does it feel like to know someone was in your space?*

---

# THE ACADEMY'S REACH

***Tier 2 Social***
*A sending stone pulses on a desk in the dragon's jaw. Messages arrive in a voice that is polite, clinical, and does not use a name. Somewhere far away, someone is writing a report.*
**Impulses:** Catalog the anomalous, reclaim institutional property, quantify the unquantifiable

> **Difficulty:** 14
> **Potential Adversaries:** Royal Advisor, War Wizard, Secret-Keeper, Courtesan

## FEATURES

***The Sending Stone - Passive:*** Once the communication kit is opened, the sending stone pulses at irregular intervals. Messages arrive from the Academy — formal, addressed to "the Alprazepam Construct." They request status reports, operational parameters, and "evidence of continued functionality." A PC can make a Knowledge Roll to compose a response that satisfies the Academy without revealing too much. On a success, the messages become less frequent. On a failure, the next message is more specific — and asks for the construct's exact location.

  *What does it feel like to be addressed as a thing by people who once called you a student? How do you answer a question about your "functionality" when what they're really asking is whether you're still useful?*

***Alprazepam's Letter - Action:*** Reveal the sealed letter inside the communication kit: *"I sent you away because they were going to disassemble you. Prove them wrong."* This reframes everything — the sudden expulsion, Vinos's silence, the indefinite "journey." There are no rolls. Just the weight of understanding.

  *Who reads it first? Who do they tell? What does Vinos's face look like when someone finally asks him why he never opened the kit?*

***The Observer Arrives - Action:*** Spend a Fear to have a young Academy representative arrive at the settlement. They're nervous, fascinated, and carrying a clipboard. Their questions sound academic but feel like an inventory: "Can you describe your decision-making process? Do you experience preference?" A PC can make a Presence Roll to redirect the conversation. On a success, the observer begins to see a person instead of a subject. On a failure, the observer writes down something clinical and the temperature in the room drops.

  *What question does the observer ask that cuts deepest? Is it the one about feelings, or the one about purpose?*

***Property or Person - Reaction:*** When any PC publicly defends the construct's personhood — to the observer, in a letter, to anyone from outside — the Academy's tone shifts. Future messages replace "the Alprazepam Construct" with a name. This is small. It is everything. If no one defends it, the language stays clinical, and the next stage of the escalation arrives sooner.

  *What does it cost to stand up for someone's right to exist? What does it cost not to?*

---

# MISFORTUNE THICKET

***Tier 2 Traversal***
*The canopy closes overhead. Amber light filters through leaves that buzz — not from wind, but from thousands of iridescent bees in the foliage. The honey scent is overwhelming. Every surface is faintly sticky.*
**Impulses:** Punish the clumsy, tax all who pass, guard the queen's domain

> **Difficulty:** 14
> **Potential Adversaries:** Bear, Oak Treant, Tangle Bramble Swarm, Giant Beastmaster

## FEATURES

***The Sticky Path - Passive:*** Traversing the thicket uses a Progress Countdown (8). It ticks down according to the following criteria when PCs make an action roll to navigate:

  - Critical Success: Tick down 3
  - Success with Hope: Tick down 2
  - Success with Fear: Tick down 1
  - Failure with Hope: No advancement
  - Failure with Fear: Tick up 1

  When the countdown triggers, the party has made it through the thicket.

  *What does it feel like to walk for an hour and end up where you started? When does frustration become funny — and when does funny become frightening?*

***Misfortune Aura - Passive:*** While in the thicket, PCs have disadvantage on Agility and Finesse Rolls. A PC can spend a Hope to suppress the effect for a single roll.

  *What small thing goes wrong first — a stumble, a dropped item, a suddenly loose strap?*

***Bee Tax - Action:*** Spend a Fear. A scouting swarm descends on a PC and demands a toll — food, a shiny object, a drop of blood (mark a Stress), or a flower. If the offering is accepted, the swarm escorts the PC forward (tick down the countdown by 2). If rejected, the swarm stings — the PC takes 1d8+4 physical damage and develops a faintly glowing welt (disadvantage on any roll to hide or move unnoticed for the remainder of the traversal).

  *What do the bees take from you? Is there something you carry that you'd never surrender, even to avoid pain?*

***The Queen's Regard - Reaction:*** When the party reaches the final stretch of the countdown (3 or fewer remaining) without having killed any bees, the Bee Queen appears — hovering at eye level, wings thrumming at a frequency felt in the chest. She is evaluating. A PC can make a Presence Roll to communicate intent. On a success, passage is permitted and the Queen offers a small comb of honey (a rare alchemical ingredient). On a failure, the Queen leaves and the remaining countdown ticks require a success with Hope to advance. If any bees were killed during traversal, the Queen does not appear.

  *What does royalty look like when it isn't human? What does her gaze feel like — judgment, curiosity, or something you don't have a word for?*

---

# JADE NURSERY

***Tier 2 Exploration***
*A hidden valley carpeted in emerald moss, ringed by Jade Trees whose canopy filters sunlight into shifting green patterns. The air hums faintly — dragon-bone minerals in the soil resonate at a frequency felt in the teeth.*
**Impulses:** Shelter the vulnerable, reject the unwelcome, remember what was here before

> **Difficulty:** 13
> **Potential Adversaries:** Bear, Deeproot Defender, Young Dryad, Stag Knight

## FEATURES

***Restorative Ground - Passive:*** Any creature resting in the valley for an hour or more can clear 1 Stress. This effect works once per visit. A PC with an appropriate background or Experience can also recover 1 Hit Point and learn one detail about the valley's ecology.

  *What tension are you holding that you didn't realize until it eased? When was the last time you felt this calm?*

***Herd Awareness - Passive:*** The moose herd operates as a collective intelligence in this space. Sudden movements, loud noises, or aggressive postures cause the entire herd to orient toward the source simultaneously. A PC must succeed on an Instinct Roll to move through the valley without triggering herd awareness. On a failure with Hope, the herd watches but stays calm. On a failure with Fear, the alpha positions itself between the PC and the calves and the herd begins to move away.

  *What does it feel like to be watched by something that remembers what you did last time? How do you move when you know you're being evaluated?*

***Root Warning - Reaction:*** When a PC attempts to harvest Jade Tree wood, dig up soil, or take mineral samples, the tree roots shift audibly — a deep grinding sound like bones settling. The ground beneath the PC becomes soft. The PC must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or become Restrained until freed with a successful Strength Roll. The valley protects itself.

  *The roots didn't attack — they held you still. What's the difference between a trap and a boundary?*

***The Offering - Action:*** A PC leaves something at the valley's edge — food, a personal item, something grown. The valley doesn't respond immediately. On the next visit, something has changed — a path is clearer, a creature is closer, a new plant has appeared near where the offering was left. Trust is not given; it's cultivated.

  *What did you leave behind? What did you hope would happen?*

---

# SIEGE OF EXPECTATIONS

***Tier 2 Event***
*The settlement on the longest day of summer. Structures with roofs. Paths worn into the grass. Smoke visible from the ridge. Today it feels like a stage — every corner holds a conversation that could change everything.*
**Impulses:** Apply pressure from every angle, force choices before anyone's ready, expose what matters most

> **Difficulty:** 15
> **Potential Adversaries:** Petty Noble, Merchant Baron, Royal Advisor, Spellblade

## FEATURES

***Summer's End - Passive:*** Activate a Long-Term Countdown (6) representing the end of summer. It ticks once per in-game week. When it triggers, three things arrive simultaneously: an Academy observer, a Flipped Coin escalation, and a Boreas family deadline.

  *If you could only prepare for one of the three, which would you choose — and what does that say about what matters most?*

***The Four Fires - Action:*** Present one of the faction pressures as a scene requiring immediate attention. Each is a Presence or Knowledge Roll depending on the approach. The party chooses the order. Addressing one means the others continue to simmer unattended.

  *Which fire do you tackle first? Which one do you keep glancing at while dealing with the others?*

***The Pear Tree Omen - Reaction:*** When the Long-Term Countdown ticks, the pear tree drops a fruit. It splits on impact, revealing seeds that have already sprouted inside — tiny green tendrils reaching outward. A Knowledge Roll reveals this is impossible for normal pear trees. The dragon-bone minerals have accelerated it beyond natural limits. By autumn: saplings. By next year: an orchard.

  *Is this a gift or a warning? Whose legacy is taking root — and can you control what it becomes?*

***Hearthstone Summit - Reaction:*** When the party gathers to discuss their priorities, the environment's mechanical pressure releases. No rolls. No countdowns ticking. Just conversation and firelight. The GM takes notes on what they decide.

  *What does this place mean to you now — compared to when you first arrived? If you had to leave tomorrow, what would you fight to take with you?*

---

## Pacing Notes

Frieren-style rhythm: quiet, quiet, heavy, adventure, adventure, aftermath. Repeat. Never two heavy sessions in a row. After weight, give them something light — a cooking scene, a shopping trip, a day of building. Comedy isn't filler. It's what makes the emotional beats land.

End sessions on quiet images, not cliffhangers. A sunset. Someone sitting alone. A door closing. Anticipation through beauty, not anxiety.

Let silence do the work. Describe a scene and ask: "What do you do?" Don't prompt action.

The most important things happen quietly.
