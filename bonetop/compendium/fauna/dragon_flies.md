<div class="section-label">Description</div>
<p>Tiny dragons no larger than common dragonflies, with oversized insectoid compound eyes. Despite their diminutive size, they are unmistakably draconic in form—scaled bodies, vestigial wings, and miniature horns.</p>
</div>

<div class="bestiary-section">
<div class="section-label">Behavior</div>
<p>Dragon-flies hunt in coordinated armada formations, overwhelming slower insects in the area with sheer numbers. They breathe intense but short-ranged flames, effective only at close quarters. Highly territorial when defending their nests.</p>
</div>

<div class="bestiary-section">
<div class="section-label">Field Notes</div>
<p>Their nests are remarkable structures found on the beach—they superheat sand with their collective breath to form small glass domes, which serve as communal dwellings. The glass catches light beautifully at dawn.</p>
