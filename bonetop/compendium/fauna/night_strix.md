<div class="section-label">Description</div>
<p>A giant owl with a single large eye centered on its face, ecologically similar to a golden eagle or great horned owl. Its feathers shimmer with an unusual quality that allows it to blend seamlessly into the night sky, becoming nearly invisible against the stars.</p>
</div>

<div class="bestiary-section">
<div class="section-label">Behavior</div>
<p>The Night Strix can trap creatures in another dimension, presumably a pocket realm accessible only through its cyclopean gaze. The exact mechanism and duration of this entrapment remains under study. Curiously, the creature has a strong aversion to prey carrying teeth, and will avoid hunting such targets.</p>

<p class="placeholder-text">No field notes recorded yet. Exercise extreme caution when observing—avoid direct eye contact with the creature's single eye.</p>
