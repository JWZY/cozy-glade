<div class="section-label">Description</div>
<p>Large moose-like creatures with mossy antlers and green-tinged wool. Their wool takes its colour from their diet — they eat so much moss it tints their fur, much like flamingos turning pink from shrimp. When sleeping, they resemble mounds of moss on the forest floor, which attracts Rolling Moss to roll onto them — a relationship the Roly Polys find significantly less charming. They travel in herds led by a dominant alpha.</p>

<div class="section-label">Behaviour</div>
<p>Wooly Moss Moose forage for Rolling Moss ("Roly Polys") and swallow them whole like jawbreakers. They hold them in their mouths, slowly licking away all the moss until only the bare rock core remains, then spit out the stones. Trails of spit-slick rocks are a reliable sign of Moose grazing activity.</p>
<p>When threatened, they spit half-licked moss balls at enemies with surprising force and accuracy.</p>

<div class="section-label">Field Notes</div>
<p>First catalogued by the settlers of Bonetop during a foraging expedition. Halden attempted to domesticate the herd alpha, which was in heat and became obsessively affectionate — but the herd escaped after a chase through the forest. The alpha looked back at Halden before disappearing into the trees.</p>
<p><em>Notable individual: the alpha has a brother with darker moss and a scar across one eye.</em></p>
