## Description

A curious hybrid creature combining the stocky build of a wild boar with the powerful hind legs and bulbous eyes of a frog. Its mottled green-brown hide is speckled with darker spots, while a distinctive yellow underbelly marks it as a wetland dweller. Small tusks protrude from its snout, useful for rooting through mud and soil.

## Behavior

Frog Boars are **crepuscular foragers**, most active during dawn and dusk when the soil is damp and truffles release their strongest scent. Their powerful frog-like legs allow them to make surprising leaps when startled, despite their rotund appearance.

- **Diet**: Primarily truffles, mushrooms, roots, and aquatic plants
- **Social**: Found in small family groups called "puddles"
- **Mating**: Lays eggs in shallow water during spring rains
- **Lifespan**: 12-15 years

## Habitat

Found near **marshes, riverbanks, and flooded forests** where their amphibious nature gives them an advantage. They dig burrows in muddy banks that flood during high water, switching between air-breathing on land and absorbing oxygen through their skin underwater.

## Field Notes

> *"Saw one of these beauties surface in the bog yesterday—thought it was just bubbles at first, then up comes this tusked face with those big glassy eyes. Watched it dig up three truffles in under a minute. Remarkable snout on 'em."*
