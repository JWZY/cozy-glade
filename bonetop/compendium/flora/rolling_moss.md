<div class="section-label">Description</div>
<p>Rocks that gather moss into dense, self-propelled balls, slowly rolling across the forest floor of their own accord. Affectionately nicknamed "Roly Polys" by the settlers. The core is a smooth stone — revealed when Wooly Moss Moose lick all the moss clean off and spit the rocks out.</p>

<div class="bestiary-section">
<div class="section-label">Behaviour</div>
<p>Prefers moist lakeside areas for gathering more moss. Can float across the lake to "travel to other far places." Moves at surprising speed when startled — described as rolling away "at Mach speed." Capable of speech when communed with via Nature's Tongue; speaks in a chill, matter-of-fact tone. Refers to Wooly Moss Moose as "wooly terrors" and avoids the riverside where they roam.</p>

<div class="section-label">Field Notes</div>
<p>First caught by Ellery using a bucket and Mage Hand, as an errand for Nellie. Oleg communed with it and it directed the party toward the Wooly Moss Moose by the riverside.</p>
<p><em>Ellery noted that the jade trees thin out approaching the river, eventually disappearing entirely — other tree types remain. Cause unknown.</em></p>
