<ul>
<li>Three months have passed — snow melted, summer arrived, Bonetop has taken shape</li>
<li>Halden built homesteads for everyone; Ellery designed a floating library with no entrance; Oleg kept crashing Finley's Hot Goss Club</li>
<li>Nellie lost her eyebrows to Bad Luck Bees; Vinos still hasn't opened his communication kit</li>
<li>On a foraging walk, Ellery burst out of the brush chasing a Rolling Moss ("Roly Poly")</li>
<li>Oleg communed with it — learned about "wooly terrors" by the riverside: Wooly Moss Moose that swallow Roly Polys whole like jawbreakers</li>
<li>Halden saw livestock — lured the alpha with a mossy rock, but the alpha was in heat and imprinted on him instead</li>
<li>Ellery put the alpha to sleep; the party ran with it; the herd gave chase</li>
<li>Oleg cleared the forest path with a critical Nature's Tongue — "I love you! Move aside! Big fan!"</li>
<li>Oleg mimicked the alpha's voice to stall the herd — the alpha woke up furious at the identity theft</li>
<li>Ellery's dampening bracelet shattered in the stampede</li>
<li>Halden charged toward the alpha but froze — a flashback to his vow to Anja, to never harm another creature — rolled a 3</li>
<li>The alpha broke free, looked back with eyes not of rage but of betrayal, and led the herd into the forest</li>
<li>Halden sat on the ground, bruised. "Well... shit."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wooly Moss Moose</strong> — Green-wooled moose that eat Rolling Moss like jawbreakers. The alpha has a brother with darker moss and a scar across one eye.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Moss</strong> — Can speak. Prefers the lakeside. Calls the moose "wooly terrors." Rolls at Mach speed when scared.</li>
<li><strong>Jade Tree Gradient</strong> — The jade trees thin out approaching the river and vanish entirely. Cause unknown.</li>
</ul>
