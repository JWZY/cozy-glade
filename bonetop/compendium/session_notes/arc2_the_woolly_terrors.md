<p>Three months have passed. Snow melted, summer arrived, and Bonetop has taken shape — Halden built homesteads for everyone, Ellery designed a floating library with no entrance, and Oleg kept crashing Finley's Hot Goss Club. Nellie lost her eyebrows to Bad Luck Bees. Vinos still hasn't opened his communication kit.</p>
<p>On a routine foraging walk, Ellery burst out of the brush chasing a Rolling Moss — a self-propelled rock ball the settlers dubbed a "Roly Poly." Oleg communed with it and learned about the "woolly terrors" by the riverside: Wooly Moss Moose, large green-wooled creatures that swallow Roly Polys whole like jawbreakers and lick them clean.</p>
<p>Halden saw livestock. He lured the alpha with a mossy rock — but the alpha was in heat and imprinted on him instead. Ellery put it to sleep and the party ran. The herd gave chase. Oleg cleared the forest path with a critical Nature's Tongue ("I love you! Move aside! Big fan!"), then mimicked the alpha's voice to stall the herd — but the alpha woke up furious at the identity theft.</p>
<p>The chase collapsed. Ellery's dampening bracelet shattered in the stampede. Halden charged toward the alpha, but froze — a flashback to his vow to Anja, to never harm another creature. He rolled a 3. The alpha broke free, looked back at him with eyes not of rage but of betrayal, and led the herd into the forest at a trot.</p>
<p>Halden sat on the ground, bruised. "Well... shit."</p>

<p><strong>Wooly Moss Moose</strong> — Green-wooled moose that eat Rolling Moss like jawbreakers. The alpha has a brother with darker moss and a scar across one eye.</p>
<p><strong>Rolling Moss</strong> — Can speak. Prefers the lakeside. Calls the moose "woolly terrors." Rolls at Mach speed when scared.</p>
<p><strong>Jade Tree Gradient</strong> — The jade trees thin out approaching the river and vanish entirely. Cause unknown.</p>

<p>Halden's moose got away. Ellery needs a new bracelet before the library goes up. Oleg called Halden "dad." Nobody has talked about the scarred brother yet.</p>
