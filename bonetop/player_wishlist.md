# Player Wishlist

*DM reference — things players have expressed interest in doing. Pull from this when planning arcs.*

---

## Halden (Jake)
- **Hunt the Bad Luck Bee Queen** — Wants a session where the party tracks down the queen of the bad luck bees and harvests honey. Could tie into tavern ingredients (mead?) or trade goods.
- **Domesticate the Wooly Moss Moose** — First attempt failed. The alpha escaped with "eyes of betrayal." This is now a nemesis arc — Halden needs to earn its trust back. The dice made this personal by exposing his Anja conflict.
- **Recruit settlers** — Wants reasons for new people to come to Bonetop.

## Oleg (Token)
- **Find the Jub-jub Leader** — Wants to seek out and make contact with whoever leads the Jub-jubs. Spirit contract opportunity? Follow the teeth.
- **Lesser spirit contracts** — Can't break through to the dragon spirits directly. Looking for smaller deals to build up to it.

## Ellery (Cheez)
- **Fix the dampening bracelet** — Broke during the moose stampede. Can't raise the library without it.
- **Design an entrance for the library** — She forgot. This is a charming ongoing problem.

## Emergent Threads (from the dice)
*These weren't requested but the session created them organically.*

- **Halden's Anja conflict** — His vow not to harm creatures caused a critical failure at the worst moment. This is now the core of his arc. Every encounter with wildlife will test this tension.
- **The Mufasa/Scar moose dynamic** — The alpha has a scarred, dark-mossed brother. Players established this collaboratively. Use it.
- **Ellery as "just wood"** — The moose herd ignored her completely. She's a wooden construct. How does she feel about that?
- **Oleg as the family glue** — Called Halden "dad," acts as mediator with nature. He's becoming the emotional center of the party without realizing it.
