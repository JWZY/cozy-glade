# Oleg

**Species:** Goblin (mixed ancestry - Infernis)

## Backstory
- youngest son of the goblin crime syndicate “The Flipped Coin”
- Oleg was weeks away from his rite of passage
- The image of the coin landing on heads was a wave of nausea, “Heads means ‘their heads roll!’” his brothers would jeer. His mother would tap her nails expectantly.
- *This was stressing his aura*
- Oleg withdrew into his eccentricities.
- He discussed the matter extensively with the trees and spirits below.
- Only the East Wind answered:
- A crumpled flyer hit him in the face
- “A Ground breaking experience: Join the New World!”
- The next day he was packed, his prized possessions (all stolen) cramped in a satchel: *Compendium of Fae Spirits*, *The Energy of Nature*, A black ring, and a box of shiny objects
- The large scarf hugged him. His gloves thrummed with energy.
- His boots sang as he approached the caravan.

## Short-term/immediate goals

**Preparing space for settlement:**
- Oleg, with the help of who's willing, will work to clear out a perimeter of land to establish the settlement
(I.e. clearing trees, clearing pests / deterring wildlife)

**Shelter:**
- Gathering firewood, setting up a watch rotation, and deterrents/traps for local wildlife.

## Long term goals he's working towards

**Establishing himself with the local spiritual realm:**
- Seeking favour with the local creatures/spirits. I.e. planting mushrooms in circles to gain favour with the local Fae-spirits.

**Gaining rapport with his fellow settlers.**

**Deterring the Flipped Coin from seeking him out:** sending them a clear signal he has no intention of returning.
