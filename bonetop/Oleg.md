# Oleg

**Ancestry:** Goblin (mixed ancestry - Infernis)

## Short-term Goals

**Commune with the dragon spirits** — Stuck; hitting a wall trying to connect with the dragon spirits directly.
- In the meantime, seeking out lesser spirits to make contracts with.
- Forages with Halden regularly.
- Wants to find the leader of the Jub-jubs.

## Long-term Goals

**Establish himself with the local spiritual realm** — Seeking favour with the local creatures/spirits, planting mushrooms in circles to gain favour with the local Fae-spirits.

**Gain rapport with his fellow settlers**

**Deter the Flipped Coin** — Sending them a clear signal he has no intention of returning.

## Relationships

- **Ellery** — Birdwatching buddies (for fun)
- **Halden** — Regular foraging partners
- **Finley** — Crashes his Hot Goss Club meetings
- **Nellie** — Golden retriever energy, desperately trying to win her over. She hates spiritualists. His attempts to help always backfire and creep her out or make things worse. Running gag.

## Completed Goals

- ~~Clear a perimeter of land to establish the settlement~~
- ~~Set up shelter, watch rotation, and wildlife deterrents/traps~~

## Appearance
- Short stature; lightweight build
- Goblin with pastel purple skin
- Notable small horns poking out of his hat
- Lighter hair, warm eyes
- Messy 'hockey hair'
- Wears loose, comfortable clothes

## Backstory
- Youngest son of the goblin crime syndicate "The Flipped Coin"
- Oleg was weeks away from his rite of passage
- The image of the coin landing on heads was a wave of nausea. "Heads means 'their heads roll!'" his brothers would jeer. His mother would tap her nails expectantly.
- *This was stressing his aura*
- Oleg withdrew into his eccentricities.
- He discussed the matter extensively with the trees and spirits below.
- Only the East Wind answered:
- A crumpled flyer hit him in the face
- "A ground-breaking experience: Join the New World!"
- The next day he was packed, his prized possessions (all stolen) crammed in a satchel: *Compendium of Fae Spirits*, *The Energy of Nature*, A black ring, and a box of shiny objects
- The large scarf hugged him. His gloves thrummed with energy.
- His boots sang as he approached the caravan.
