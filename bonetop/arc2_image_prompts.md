# Arc 2 Image Prompts — Establishing Shots

*For use with Gemini Nano Banana Pro + Frieren S2 reference images*

---

## Style Preamble (use with every prompt)

Paste this before each scene prompt so the model stays consistent:

> **Style reference: [attach Frieren images]** Generate a wide establishing shot in the style of these reference images. Painterly anime background art with rich, layered depth. Soft atmospheric perspective, dappled natural lighting, visible brushwork in foliage and sky. No characters in the foreground — this is a landscape shot. Aspect ratio 16:9. High detail, cinematic composition.

## 1. Bonetop Settlement — Morning

> A small frontier settlement built beneath and around the calcified ribcage of an enormous ancient dragon skeleton. The massive white-grey bones arc overhead like cathedral buttresses, draped with flowering vines and moss. Timber-frame buildings with stone foundations nestle between the ribs. A glowing pear tree with faintly golden fruit stands in the central clearing. Early morning light streams through the rib gaps, casting long bone-shadows across vegetable gardens and a lumber yard. Smoke rises from a communal hearth area. Lush boreal forest surrounds the settlement. Cozy, lived-in, fragile.

## 2. The Bone-Tender Mandala

> An overhead wide shot of a frontier lumber yard transformed into sacred geometry. Every plank, beam, and wood offcut has been arranged overnight into concentric spiral patterns radiating from a central ancient tree stump. Glowing red-orange lines of crystallized tree sap trace veins between the wooden rings, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. Tiny crab-like spirit creatures with iridescent shells sit motionless in the gaps between the spirals, watching. Dawn light. The pattern is unmistakably intentional — alien, beautiful, and waiting for a response. Dragon bones frame the background.

## 3. The Caravan Arrives

> A wide shot of a trade caravan arriving at a frontier settlement built within a dragon skeleton. Colorful merchant tarps and awnings are being stretched between massive calcified dragon ribs, creating a makeshift market. Wagons loaded with goods line a dirt road. The settlement is half-built — scaffolding on some structures, raw timber stacked. The contrast between the ancient bones overhead and the bustling new activity below. Late morning, warm golden light, dust motes in the air. A sense of a small world suddenly getting much bigger.

## 4. The Misfortune Thicket — Bee Queen's Domain

> A dense forest path where the canopy closes overhead like a living tunnel. Amber-gold light filters through leaves that shimmer with thousands of tiny iridescent bees embedded in the foliage. Every surface — bark, stones, fallen logs — has a faint sticky golden sheen of wild honey. The path ahead is clear but narrow, winding between massive ancient trees with dark bark. Floating pollen and tiny glowing particles in the air. Beautiful and deeply unsettling. The light is warm but the shadows are watchful. Humid, heavy, sweet.

## 5. The Jade Nursery — Hidden Valley

> A hidden valley carpeted in deep emerald moss, ringed by enormous trees with jade-green translucent bark that seems to glow faintly from within. Sunlight filters through the canopy in shifting green patterns, creating dappled pools of light on the forest floor. Dragon-bone mineral deposits glint white in the dark soil between exposed roots. A small clearing where the moss is thickest, undisturbed. The air looks thick with warmth — visible humidity, floating spores, utter stillness. A place that feels ancient, protected, and sacred. Studio Ghibli nature sanctuary energy.

## 6. The Lake at Twilight

> A wide panoramic shot of a still freshwater lake at sunset. The water reflects pink and purple clouds. Rolling forested hills surround the lake. In the far background, the silhouette of a massive dragon skeleton rises above the treeline — the settlement barely visible beneath it. The near shore has wildflowers and tall grass. The lake's surface is almost perfectly still, but something is faintly visible just beneath the water — a dark shape, partially obscured, not quite identifiable. Mysterious but not threatening. Melancholic beauty. The last light of a long summer day.

## 7. The Forest Edge at Dusk

> A wide meadow at the edge of a boreal forest at blue hour. Tall dark conifers frame the scene. Fireflies drift between exposed dragon rib bones that jut from the ground like ancient fence posts. In the distance, warm orange light glows from a small settlement. The foreground is wild grass and small white flowers. The sky is deep purple fading to dark blue with the first stars appearing. The boundary between civilization and wilderness. Peaceful but liminal — the feeling of standing between two worlds.

## 8. The Pear Tree — Golden Hour

> A single pear tree standing alone in a clearing, unnaturally tall and lush for its age. Its fruit glows with a faint golden luminescence. The tree grows from soil laced with white dragon-bone mineral veins visible at the roots. Late afternoon golden hour light catches the luminous fruit, creating a warm halo effect. Small creatures — round frog-like beasts with tusks, colorful birds — circle at a respectful distance, drawn to the tree but not approaching. The roots are visibly spreading into a nearby herb garden. Beautiful abundance on the edge of becoming something uncontrollable.

## 9. Crystal Pine Forest — Night

> A nighttime forest scene among enormous pine trees whose bark is veined with crystallized red-orange sap. The sap glows faintly, creating natural light lines that trace up the trunks like circuits. The forest floor is carpeted in bioluminescent moss — cool blue-green light from below, warm amber-red from the tree veins above. Stars visible through gaps in the canopy. Absolute stillness. The kind of forest that feels like it's breathing. Magical realism, not fantasy cliche — the light feels natural, not spell-like.

## 10. Bonetop — End of Summer

> The same dragon-skeleton settlement from prompt 1, but now in late summer decline. The light is lower, more amber. The pear tree is enormous now, almost too large, heavy with glowing fruit. Leaves are just starting to show the first hints of turning. The buildings are more complete but weathered. Garden plots are overgrown. There's a weariness to the abundance — too much fruit, too many vines on the bones, nature pressing in. Beautiful and heavy. The golden hour of something that can't last. A place worth protecting precisely because it's fragile.

## Tips for Nano Banana Pro

- **Attach 2-3 Frieren refs per generation**, not all 5 — pick the ones closest in composition to what you want (e.g., use the stream image for Jade Nursery, the meadow-at-dusk for Forest Edge)
- **Generate at 16:9** for establishing shots your players can use as virtual tabletop backgrounds
- **Iterate with follow-ups** like "same scene but pull the camera back further" or "shift the lighting to blue hour" — Gemini is good at these adjustments
- **Avoid naming characters** in the prompts — keep these as empty stages. If you want a figure, say "a small silhouette in the middle distance" rather than naming anyone
- The **dragon skeleton detail** is your visual signature — include it as a background element in most shots to tie the series together even when focusing on forest/nature scenes
