# Bory's Goals

**Player:** southernetobicokelove (Pat)  
**Character:** Bory Golfo - Former mob enforcer  
**Ancestry/Class:** Skyborne Ribbet Brawler (juggernaut)  
**Abilities:** Forceful Push, Untouchable

## Long Term
Bory is finding ways to suppress his anger. He's tried therapy. That's helping but not fully. He's tried religion he's hopeful but doubtful. He's tried thinking about his heritage but he has no clue where to start. He wants to find something to give him meaning besides POWER.

## Mid Term
**Revised goals:**

1. Seek an audience with Julia Farclaw -- who thinks Bory has it out for her -- to earnestly apologise.
2. Gain the trust from Julia to rejoin the Farclaw gang.

**Context:** Healthy Bory wants to be legitimate. Function properly and reconnect with his Julia. Angry Bory wants anarchy and revenge on Julia.

**Additional note:** Rejoin the Farclaws / join a better gang.

## Short Term
**Revised goal:**

To hurt a rival gang of Julia's by finding a building code violation to use against them.

*(Note: We might be able to connect this to other folk's goals once they start pouring in.)*

**Context:** To prove he's not a threat, he needs to earnestly apologize -- a thing he's been practicing for months in the mirror. The last 5/8 hasn't resulted in him punching the mirror. He knows that's enough. Like truly he took his punishment properly, did his time in prison. The family respects him but thinks he's a loose cannon and baggage.

To prove he's useful he needs to hurt a rival family. Not in his typical bodily way but in a black mail cunning way. He wants dirt on this family. He's not good at espionage. He thinks maybe a building code violation is what she'd want? He wants to use his brain and not his fists to prove he's changed.

## Full Backstory

Bory grew up with Julia Farclaw. Her dad was the head of the Farclaw crime syndicate. As Julia rose through the ranks she brought Bory with her, acting as her main enforcer. They ruled the city for many years being protected by the Farclaw family until Julia's father was killed by a rival gang. 

A huge gang war took place. Bory acted as the head general on the streets. The Farclaw family got revenge and complete control of the city. Bory was proud of the war, Julia was not.

### The Pivot to Legitimacy

As the new leader of the family, Julia pivoted to making the family more legitimate. Investing in businesses, making friendships in politics and keeping the crime low key. Bory didn't fit well in Julia's plan. After years of making messes he finally went too far. **Bory killed a mayoral candidate who was besmirching Julia's name.** This gave the feds all the power to dismantle the entire family. Using the murder as a springboard to get a large majority of her family on other cases. 

Julia told Bory to take the blame for all the other crimes as punishment. Pleading guilty for everything to get the rest of the family off the hook. **Bory was sentenced to life.**

### Prison Years

He was filled with rage at how his best friend sold him out. He wanted to kill her. She wrote to him apologizing and he wrote back death threat after death threat after death threat. After a while she stopped writing and they completely stopped talking. She never sent anyone to deal with Bory, she just let him be. Which hurt even more.

After years of bouncing around different gangs in different prisons, each having a "kill or be killed" mentality, which ended with him killing a lot of people and becoming "top dog," he was miserable. He realized what Julia was trying to do was a better way to live and he hated that he couldn't fit in that world.

### The Cellmate & Transformation

Bory got a cellmate who let him talk out his emotions and feelings. Realizing that the anger he felt towards Julia was really anger towards himself for feeling inadequate. He and his new robo cellmate spent 2 years working on his anger and in those 2 years **Bory only killed 4 prisoners.** He was getting a better handle on his anger and could see himself possibly fitting into a Julia system. 

Julia was a trigger for him. He fantasized about killing her a lot but he also fantasized about the good old days. **The two wishes exist in him.**

### Prison Planet Reunion

Julia eventually became mayor and the city was humming. A rat from within the system leaked her criminal doings to the feds and she got got. Sentenced to life on the NEW prison planet. **Bory and Julia were going to be in the same place at the same time for the first time in 15 years.**

## Important NPC: Julia Farclaw

**Character:** Julia Farclaw - Head of the Farclaw family, Former Mayor  
**Ancestry/Class:** Slyborne Drakona Warlock (Pact of the Endless)  
**Warlock Patron:** "Capitalism and Democracy"  
**Abilities:** Deft Deceiver and Inspirational Words

### Backstory

Julia's need for control after her father died and the war happened led her to give her loyalty to the God of order and money. She found great success in their ways, becoming the mayor of one of the largest cities in the world: **New Rochelle**. 

She sacrificed her best friend Bory to the system to appease her Gods. She slipped up and hired one of her wife's family members to keep track of her books, and the Gods punished her for her nepotism. Poor bookkeeping got Julia arrested and brought to prison planet. 

Julia went a little crazy losing so much and is taking becoming the ruler of this planet to be her main goal.

### Julia's Goals (NPC)

All of her goals would be to **maintain order**. Create a functional society out of this group of criminals to prove to the feds she's a great leader.

- **Short term:** Destroy the more chaotic forces opposing her

### Character Arc Discussion

**Dynamic Decision:** The contrast of Bory trying to get better, more legit, and sane versus Julia going from mayor to possible dictator.

Julia truly wanted to escape criminal life. She now finds herself running a planet full of criminals. That would lead to disdain for her citizens and the situation itself.

**The Irony:** Julia went legitimate and hit rock bottom again. After trying her hardest at being legitimate as mayor, she now ironically embraces Bory's past way of life -- violence. Which ironically, 15 years later, leaves them both on opposite ends of the spectrum from where they started.

**Julia's Position:** She would be a good candidate for being on the side of "reforming" and the people trying to live by "good" on Prison Planet, but the decision was made to push her towards embracing the "bad" side, losing all hope after trying her hardest at being legitimate.
